      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:29324:3"/> Tractates, whereby the iudgement of the Reader is thorowly informed in thoſe diuine My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries, and the heart and will inclined to draw them into holy vſe; but, yet none deſerue better of the Church of God, nor ought rather to haue their names regiſtred with red Letters in the Kalender of the worthieſt Saints, then they who in their Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings or Sermons, doe skilfully contriue the whole building or body of Diuinitie in a wel-framed plot, lay a ſound and ſure foundation, and thereupon e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect the chiefe Principles and moſt ſubſtantial parts which are the ſtrength and ſtay of all the reſt. For if the iudgement bee once thorowly informed in theſe mayne points; then is it able to deduce from them innumerable particular Concluſions for ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall information and direction in the well-orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of our liues in all ſingular actions; then may wee with profit and without perill of falling into pernicious errours, reade the holy Scriptures, when we are able to interpret them according to theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Canons and Rules; then may we heare the Word preached with vnderſtanding, and trie the ſpirits of thoſe who preach vnto vs whether they bee of God or no, when wee haue skill to examine their Doctrines according to this Analogie of Faith, and can trie them by this neuer-deceiuing Touchſtone, whether they bee pure metall, or but reprobate ſiluer, and counterfait coyne. Then ſhall we be more ſtrongly armed againſt all aſſaults of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies and aduerſaries to the Truth, falſe Sedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers and ſubtill Heretikes, and be better able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend that Veritie which we profeſſe, and conuince
<pb facs="tcp:29324:3"/> them of their errours and lyes; then (wanting this helpe) if we ſhould ſpend our whole time in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of Controuerſies, and euen dimme our eyes, and tyre our braynes in the peruſing and ſtudying of Polemicall diſcourſes. For, theſe many grounds of Truth doe yeeld from them ſuch a cleere light, that they do not only appeare in their owne bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, but alſo diſcouer the blackneſſe of errour, and from one Principle well vnderſtood, wee inferre the falſhood of innumerable contrarie Concluſions: whereof it is, that we ſhall very rarely obſerue any well-grounded in the fundamentall points of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, to fall into the ſnares of ſubtill Seducers: whereas contrariwiſe wee may commonly ſee, that thoſe who are ignorant of them, though neuer ſo ſharpe-ſighted in curious ſpeculations, doe become an eaſie prey, and are quickly catched in the nets of their Sophiſtrie. In which reſpects it were much to bee wiſhed, that both Miniſters would bee more frequent and diligent in laying theſe grounds in their Teaching and Writing; and alſo that the people would receyue this more ſolid and ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall foode with a better appetite. The which of both is too much neglected, becauſe how ſoeuer theſe grounds are moſt neceſſarie, yet they doe not make ſo glorious a ſhew as other points leſſe ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiall, becauſe like a ſure foundation they are plaine and vnpoliſhed; whereas the other being beautifully garniſhed with wit and eloquence, doe delight the ſenſe, and more pleaſingly worke vpon the heart and affections. And yet we muſt acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to Gods glorie, who hath giuen theſe gifts to
<pb facs="tcp:29324:4"/> men, and grace to vſe them, that there haue not beene wanting in theſe latter times many famous Worthies, who haue happily laboured in this kind, and with great ſoundneſſe and perſpicuitie haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered and cleered theſe mayne points by their ſpeaking and writing. Among which (Chriſtian Reader) I commend vnto thee the Author of this Booke, as deſeruing iuſtly to be ranked among the beſt, both for Method and Matter, ſound handling of the chiefe points of Chriſtian Religion, and for cleering by the way diuers hard places of holy Scripture. All which hee performeth in this worke with ſuch learning, iudgement, and pietie, that had he herein reſpected the prayſes of men, hee might well haue graced his Name with his Worke, euen as his Worke would haue beene graced by his Name, and not as one aſhamed of ſo beautifull an off-ſpring haue ſuffered it to come abroad into the World as an Orphan, the Father ſtill liuing, onely vnder the name of an vnworthy God-father. The which I write not to commend the Author, who as he is farre aboue my prayſes in the high pitch of his owne worth; ſo doth he not deſire, but rather ſhunneth them; and, as to the willing, an iniurie is no iniurie; ſo, an officious dutie is no benefit, but a kind of wrong, where (the partie nilling) it is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced and obtruded. Nor yet doe I prayſe the worke for the Workers ſake, which, though it commeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad without the Fathers name, yet will, I doubt not, in ſhort time bee famous in it owne name and excellencie; but that I may with the weake thread of my cenſure draw thee to peruſe it; and ſo will it
<pb facs="tcp:29324:4"/> ſufficiently commend it ſelfe, and giue there iuſt cauſe of prayſing God for ſtirring vp ſuch Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of his Glorie and thy good.

               </argument>
               <p>THe Spirit of Chriſt being ours, conſequently doth ſaue vs from our ſinfull and curſed eſtate, to inioy all the Good that is in him.</p>
               <p>It ſtandeth in <hi>Illumination,</hi> and <hi>Iustification,</hi> and (from thence comming) <hi>Sanctification,</hi> and <hi>Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Illumination,</hi> Whereby expelling Darkeneſſe, he doth inlighten our Minds with the Knowledge of the Will of God in Chriſt; which the Apoſtle calleth Wiſdome.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iuſtification,</hi> Whereby forgiuing our ſinnes, by his taking them vpon him, he doth account the Holineſſe of his Nature and Righteouſneſſe to be ours.</p>
               <p>From whence (as I ſaid) come <hi>Sanctification,</hi> and <hi>Redemption.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sanctification,</hi> Whereby ſlaying Sinne, he putteth a new Life of Holineſſe into vs, to bring forth fruits of Righteouſneſſe. Wherein there is no more now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, but that Sinne beare not the rule in vs: and our Workes of Righteouſneſſe, though all mingled with ſinne, are not onely pleaſing vnto God, through his forgiueneſſe of the ſinne; but haue beſide, of Gods free Goodneſſe, looking vpon them in the perfection of his Sonne, ſpeciall Promiſes of Reward made vnto them, both in this Life, and in the Life to come.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Redemption,</hi> Whereby freeing vs from the Curſe, him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe becomming a Curſe for vs, he maketh vs bleſſed, by the participation of his Bleſſedneſſe.</p>
               <p>Our Bleſſedneſſe in this eſtate ſtandeth,</p>
               <p>Firſt, in the Loue of God anew: Whereby all things, not the Calamities and Troubles of this Life, and alſo Death it ſelfe, but euen our very ſinnes turne vnto our good; and in the aſſurance whereof, wee haue Peace of Conſcience, and Ioy in the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, in that wee are made neere vnto him, and haue continuall acceſſe, with boldneſſe, into his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, in our former Soueraigntie and Power ouer the Creatures; whereof commeth free liberty of vſing them all, and deliuerance from the Bondage of Satan. This alſo as a noble acceſſe added thereunto, that the holy Angels themſelues are made miniſters for our good.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:29324:16"/>
               <p>Fourthly, in a Spirituall Glorie and Wiſedome, and other Graces.</p>
               <p>After this Life, commeth the fulneſſe of Bleſſedneſſe, more or leſſe, according to the diuers meaſure of our Faith here. To the Soule in Heauen, preſently after Death, till the Latter Day: At what time our Bodies being rayſed vp glorious, the whole Man ſhall meete CHRIST comming to Iudgement in the Ayre, and there receiue Sentence of all fulneſſe of Bleſſedneſſe for euer: Which we ſhall inioy; taken vp into Heauen by the vertue of his Aſcenſion.</p>
               <p>Certaine Men, vpon our Sauiour CHRISTS Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, roſe againe, and are alreadie with him in Heauen.</p>
               <p>So are <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> both aliue, aſſumed thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>

               <p>Laſt of all, the Eternitie of God prooueth that hee is of and from himſelfe, the cauſe of his owne being, and conſequently of all good and perfect things that bee. To which purpoſe, that of IAMES <note n="z" place="margin">Iam. 1. 17.</note> is a moſt worthy ſaying, <hi>Euery good and perfect gift co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth from aboue from the Father of Lights.</hi> Two things he teacheth vs in than ſpeech; one, that in GOD is all perfection, therefore hee calleth him <hi>the Father of Light,</hi> which is as much or more then if hee ſaid Light it ſelfe.

Secondly, hee tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth that this perfection of the God-head, is the cauſe of euery perfect thing in vs. To conclude, the ſaying of <hi>Iames</hi> is in effect no more, but that which the Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> 
                  <note n="b" place="margin">Pſal. 36. 10.</note> had long before conceiued, <hi>Becauſe with thee is the fountaine of life, in thy Light doe we (or let vs) ſee light:</hi> and that from the wel-ſpring of Gods infinite perfection, doe flow the ſtreames of whatſoeuer perfectneſſe is in vs. We need not goe farre to prooue, ſith

               <p>From the Infiniteneſſe and Eternity of God, both theſe two things doe follow.

               <p>Secondly, That there is nor can bee but<note place="margin">This is it wee meane by <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honah,</hi> who vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all that hath beene ſaid, is nor can be but one.</note>

Mans nature, becauſe it is imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, doth therefore admit compoſition, and becauſe it is finite, may in part communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate it ſelfe. Whence it commeth, that <hi>Iohn</hi> and <hi>Peter,</hi> and euery ſingular man differ one from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in their eſſence and nature, becauſe the whole hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature is not, nor cannot bee in each of them, but is part in one, and part in another, and therefore they are many men. But God, becauſe he is a moſt ſingle and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and infinite eſſence, to whomſoeuer hee communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth his nature (as hee hath before all times, to his Sonne and holy Spirit) muſt needes communicate the ſame whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and perfectly, and infinitely. So as there can be but one God: for if there be many, one muſt differ from another in hauing that the other hath not: ſo can they not be perfect, much leſſe can they be perfection it ſelfe, perfection being that which both is perfect of it ſelfe, and giueth perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to all other things. But being many gods, if one ſhould giue perfection to the other, that other were not God. For hee had not his God-head of himſelfe, if all had of themſelues, none ſhould giue to other: ſo none of them were God. And infinite how can that be, which is diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted among many: for where there be many, all muſt be circumſcribed, becauſe, where one is, there cannot bee the other. But our God is ſuch a one as filleth Heauen and Earth, and cannot be circumſcribed, therefore in tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelling with a multitude of gods, they bring forth no God at all.</p>

               <p>Thirdly, being <hi>the Sonne and begotten,</hi> as before appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, hee muſt needes bee vnderſtood to bee of his Fathers Eſſence.

Priori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Times there is none, for all are Coeternall, nothing vnperfect: for what is the God-head, but perfection it ſelfe? Neyther doth the heauenly Father like vnto fleſhly Parents beget his Sonne voluntarily, ſo as he might haue begotten him, or left him vnbegotten, or may beget moe: but hee begetteth him by nature, and therefore him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone.</p>

               <p>Fourthly, Hee <hi>ſendeth forth the Holy Ghoſt</hi> out of his owne ſubſtance, and therefore is indeede and truth God, if (as ſhall bee prooued anon) the Holy Ghoſt himſelfe be God.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, The workes which only belong to God, Chriſt doth the ſame, and that in the ſame manner, as hee ſaith in <note n="o" place="margin">John 5. 19.</note> IOHH, <hi>Whatſoeuer the Father doth, the ſame the Sonne doth likewiſe.</hi> And <note n="p" place="margin">Iohn 5. 18.</note> againe, <hi>My Father worketh hitherto, and I worke.</hi> Whereupon, truely and rightly the Iewes concluded, that hee made himſelfe equall with God.

               <p>Secondly, the eſſentiall properties of the God-head, are here likewiſe to be found. He is termed Truth it ſelfe, to note the ſingleneſſe of his Nature. 1. <hi>Iohn 5. 6. The Spirit is Truth,</hi> hath an Immenſity and Infiniteneſſe of place, dwelling at once in the heart of all the Elect. 1. <hi>Cor. 3. 16. Know yee not that yee are the Temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you? Rom. 8. 9, 11. The Spirit of Chriſt that dwelleth in you.</hi> Hee lay ouer that whole maſſe and lumpe, whereof the Heauens and Earth was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards made. <hi>Gen. 1. 2. The Spirit of God lay vpon the Waters,</hi> ouer-ſpreading it as a Hen doth her Chicken. Hee filleth all things with his preſence. <hi>Pſal. 139. 7. Whither ſhall I goe from thy Spirit?</hi> Hath a free and abſolute power of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king after his owne pleaſure. 1. <hi>Cor. 12. 11. He diſtributeth his gifts as he will:</hi> for hee is the very power of God. So called <hi>Luke 1. 35. The Holy Ghoſt ſhall come vpon thee, and the power of the moſt High ſhall ouer-ſhaddow thee.</hi> And for that which <note n="e" place="margin">Mat. 12. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>Matthew</hi> ſaith, <hi>I will caſt out Deuils by the Spirit of God,</hi>

But I am filled with Vertue from the Spirit of</hi> IEHOVAH, <hi>with Iudgement, and with Power:</hi> Is of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Wiſedome and Knowledge, euen to fore-tell things to come. <hi>The</hi>

                  <hi>things that are to come, ſhall hee declare to you,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, yea, to ſound the very bottome of the moſt ſecret things of God. 1. <hi>Cor. 2. 20. The Spirit ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the depths of God.</hi> And all this hee hath from himſelfe, and of himſelfe, as moſt elegantly the <note n="h" place="margin">Eſay 40. 13, 14.</note> Prophet tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth, <hi>Who hath inſtructed the Spirit of</hi> IEHOVAH, <hi>as a man of his counſell taught him? with whom hath hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated counſell, that he might inſtruct him, and teach him the way of Iudgement, euen teach him Knowledge, and the way of Wiſedomes,</hi> (moſt abſolute and perfect Wiſedome)
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:29324:46"/> 
                  <hi>make knowne vnto him.</hi> For of Goodneſſe, what ſhall I need to ſpeake? whoſe Name it ſelfe proclaymeth his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, and whoſe

                  <hi>fruites are Lenity, Kindneſſe, Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, Faith, Meekeneſſe, Temperance, and whatſoeuer good is?</hi> Eternity is alſo his, in that, as ſhall bee ſhewed anon, he is the Creator of all things, and therefore muſt needes be, before any thing began.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, not onely his proceeding from God, but the very Name of Spirit ſheweth the Eſſence and Nature which hee is of. For as the ſpirit of a man muſt needes be truely of mans nature, and is the moſt formall and eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall part of man: ſo, and much more it muſt bee thought of the Spirit of God; vpon whom no compoſition falleth. This in effect is the Apoſtles owne Argument, 1. <hi>Cor. 2. 11. For who of men knoweth the things of man, but the ſpirit of man that is in him? So alſo none knoweth the things of God, but the Spirit of God,</hi> who is in him, and of his owne Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and Nature, as the oppoſition ſheweth plainely.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, touching the Workes which onely belong to God, of the eternall Decrees regiſtred in the <hi>Booke of</hi> IEHOVAH, the Prophet ſaith, <hi>His</hi>

                  <hi>mouth hath comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and his Spirit hath collected them.</hi> Secondly, In the Creation of all things, he wrought together with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the Sonne, <hi>Gen. 1. 2. The Spirit of God lay vpon the Waters,</hi> meaning, that as a Bird lying vpon her Egges, and couering them vnder her wings, doth by a naturall warmth and heate, which commeth from her, hatch and bring forth her young ones: So did the Spirit of God by his liuely power and working, frame and faſhion the World out of that lumpe of Waters, <hi>Iob 26. 13. By his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit he beautified</hi> (or beautifully framed) <hi>the Heauens. Eſay 40. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="56" facs="tcp:29324:47"/> the Almighty hath put life into mee.</hi> Thirdly, hee gouerneth and adminiſtreth the things created, <hi>Zach. 4. 10. The ſeuen Eyes</hi> (or Spirits) of IEHOVAH <hi>roule vp and downe vpon all the Earth.</hi> Fourthly, He hardeneth the wicked, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuereth them into a reprobate minde.

               <p>This Kingdome ſtandeth in three things, whereof the firſt are his Purpoſes, or Decrees. Then his Creation, and<note place="margin">The Kingdom of God hath two parts, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe &amp; workes. Purpoſe is his Decree before all times of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery thing.</note> thirdly, the Gouernment of the World: the Apoſtle redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth them vnto two, purpoſe, and workes, <hi>Epheſ. 1. 21. Who worketh all things after the counſell of his will.</hi> In the Counſels and Workes of God (putting them both toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) fiue things may be noted, one proper to the purpoſe of God, the other in common, appertayning both to his Workes and Purpoſe.</p>
               <p>The firſt is, as touching the Eternitie of this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, that it is before all times, that is to ſay, from euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting.</p>
               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:29324:50"/>
               <p>The ſecond, is the generalitie of his Diſpenſation, that it ſtretcheth it ſelfe to all things, to wit, to all kinds, and each particular of euery kind.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the relation betweene his Purpoſe and Workes, that he effecteth nothing, which before he hath not decreed, decreeth nothing, which in time hee doth not effect: whereupon followeth the ineuitable neceſſitie of the execution of his counſels.</p>
               <p>The fourth is, touching the Lords moſt free and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute ſtroke in this whole diſpenſation.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, That all this is proper vnto God, within the compaſſe of one<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of which will fall whatſoeuer wee are to ſpeake, concerning the Gouernment and Kingdome of God. The Apoſtle in that one ſentence elegantly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehendeth all: for in ſaying, <hi>Him that worketh, &amp;c.</hi> mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning God, he ſheweth the ſupreme cauſe before aſſigned, and maketh it proper to God, by calling him as it were by that name, and ſaying <hi>all things, hee leaueth nothing</hi> free. Now where he addeth; <hi>recording to the purpoſe, &amp; after the counſell:</hi> he giueth to vnderſtand, that nothing is wrought but that which is decreed, nothing decreed, but in time it is effected. In which words, <hi>of purpoſe &amp; counſell,</hi> the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of this Decree is alſo included, as fore-running all his Works, yea, the firſt worke of Creation it ſelfe. Laſtly, the free-will of God is expreſſed in adding, <hi>after the counſell of his will:</hi> But for a better view to be taken of them all, let vs handle theſe three apart. Therefore to begin with his Purpoſes, or Decrees, obſerue in them three things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, The Eternitie of thoſe Decrees: for as God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe is eternall, ſo are his deep and vnſearchable counſels, all of them written and decreed, or euer the World was. And as

               </p>
               <p>Wee haue done with the World, made for theſe reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Creatures. Come wee now to the reaſonable Creatures themſelues, and firſt, of the parts of reaſon, come to them both, vnderſtanding and will. The vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding part in men (for diſtinction ſake, and our bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter conceiuing of it) we commonly terme the minde, the will in them is properly called the ſoule; although the reaſonable ſoule comprehending both, bee but one.</p>
               <p>In the vnderſtanding part, two faculties are compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Knowledge, that teacheth what we ought to doe, and is the Fountaine and beginning not onely of the other faculties, but of all the Actions and Motions of our life. Vnder this, two other faculties are comprehended, Iudgement, or Wiſdome, which is the top and perfection of knowledge for diſcerning of things that differ, and conſcience, which is a part of our vnderſtanding, deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:29324:53"/> of our particular actions, eyther with them or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them; called therefore Conſcience; as if you would ſay, <hi>A knowing with or before God, vpon a right examination of our wayes in his ſight.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, Memory to lay vp in our mindes, the things which wee know and vnderſtand. The will is a facultie freely chooſing whatſoeuer it ſelfe pleaſeth, and mouing vs to doe it, and this hath the ſoueraigne command in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one, for therefore we doe a thing, not becauſe wee thinke it ought to bee done, but becauſe wee will doe it: vnder the name of will I comprehend (in this place) aſwell the deſire onely, which is before and without conſent, as that which moſt properly &amp; in common ſpeech, is onely termed the will, when a ſettled and full conſent is come.</p>
               <p>And here affections are the ſame, that conſcience is in the mind. Not ſeuerall or diſtinct faculties, but parts or motions of the wil, diuerſly inclining it to this or that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing good, according to the diuerſity of obiects that are offered, of Loue, Hatred, Ioy, Sorrow, Anger, and ſuch like.</p>
               <p>Such a free-will wee may truly ſay there is by nautre, both in men and Angels: for God hath ſet the beginning of motion in themſelues. Albeit, hee onely haue all ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute freedome in him, vpon whom dependeth the will of all other Creatures, which hee holding the reines in his owne hands, ſwayeth and ruleth which way it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth him. But to take freedome from the will, were to deſtroy the will it ſelfe.</p>
               <p>As touching the reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable<note place="margin">The Sadduces who ſaid that there was neither Angell nor Spirit, <hi>Acts</hi> 24. 8. but held good Angels to bee onely good thoughts and motions ſtirred vp of God in men, or happy ſucceſſe comming from God, and euill angels to bee euill luſts and affections, proceeding from the corruption of our nature.</note> Creatures them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues: In the Angels ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally I conſider:</p>
               <p>Firſt, that they bee Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, that is to ſay, inuiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and incorporeall ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, Perſons liuing
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:29324:54"/> and ſubſiſting by themſelues: neither vpheld in any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther nor part of another thing, <hi>Heb. 1. 14. Bee they not all miniſtring ſpirits?</hi> The oppoſition that is made, <hi>Iob</hi> 4. 18, 19. betweene the Angels and men that dwell in houſes of clay; whoſe foundation is in this duſt, prooueth them to bee of no bodily or fleſhly ſubſtance, nor of an earthly mould, but ſpirituall and celeſtiall. In <note n="z" place="margin">Col. 1. 16.</note> the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle to the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> they are termed inuiſible. And <hi>Luke 24. 39. A Spirit hath not fleſh and bone, &amp;c.</hi> The Prophet likewiſe oppoſeth Spirit, and fleſh together, <hi>Eſay</hi> 31. 2.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The ſpirit of Angels differeth from the ſoule of man in kind; for Chriſts ſoule was no Angelicall Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. <hi>He tooke not,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb. 2. 16. the Angels, but the ſeed of</hi> ABRAHAM.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, I conſider the properties of their ſpirituall na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, though common in ſome ſort to the ſoule of man, yet in them farre more excellent, and are theſe foure:</p>
               <p>Firſt, An incomparable power and ſtrength.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Agilitie and nimbleneſſe, able in a trice to diſpatch great matters. All which the Prophet noteth to be in ſpirits, <hi>Eſay 31. 3. The Egyptian is a man, and not a mighty God, and his horſes are fleſh, and not ſpirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, An excellency of Vnderſtanding, Reaſon, and other Graces, for which the Apoſtle magnifieth the Angels, 1. <hi>Cor. 13. 1. If I ſpeake with the tongue of Angels, &amp;c.</hi> Not that they haue tongues or vſe of ſpeech, but to note what grace and excellencie of diſcourſe muſt needs bee thought in them, if it might bee ſuppoſed that they ſhould ſpeake.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Immortality, which our <note n="a" place="margin">Luke 20. 36.</note> Sauiour noteth in the Angels, when he compareth together in this behalfe the eſtate of them, and of the Bleſſed, after the Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. <hi>They cannot,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>dye any more, for they are equall to the Angels.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In man I eſpecially obſerue:</p>
               <p>Firſt, His perſon, <note n="b" place="margin">Eccleſiaſt. 12. 7. 1. Cor. 2. 21.</note> conſiſting of a bodie, and a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:29324:54"/> ſoule, being a ſpirituall, and therefore immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall ſubſtance.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The faculty of ſpeaking, proper vnto him: whereupon the tongue is called our glory, becauſe it is the inſtrument whereby wee glorifie God, and excell all earthly Creatures, as may appeare, if you conferre <hi>Pſalme</hi> 16. 9. with <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 26. for that which the Pſalmiſt ſaith, <hi>Therefore my heart is glad, and my glory reioyceth, &amp;c.</hi> PE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TER rendreth, <hi>And my tongue reioyceth, &amp;c.</hi> And in this ſence it is alſo taken, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 30. 12. and <hi>Gen.</hi> 49. 6.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The <note n="c" place="margin">Gen. 1. 27.</note> two ſexes that God created in this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Man, and Woman; Man the head and chiefe; Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man the comfort and companion of his life, giuen for a helpe vnto him, as the words of God import, <hi>Geneſ. 2. 18 It is not good for man to bee alone: I will make him a helpe fit for him:</hi> and the manner of her Creation, being out of the Rib of man: for which cauſe, <hi>Adam</hi> himſelfe <note n="d" place="margin">Gen. 2. 2. 3.</note> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth, that ſhee was a helper giuen of God vnto him: <hi>But that man is the head of the woman,</hi> the Apoſtle plainly ſpeaketh, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 3, 7. where hee alſo calleth him <hi>the Image and glory of God,</hi> carrying the marke of his ſoueraignty and dominion not onely ouer other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, but in reſpect of the woman her ſelfe, who is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſaid to bee the glory of man, becauſe it is his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, to haue ſuch an excellent Creature ſubiect to him. This ſoueraignety of the man ouer the woman, is decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the Scriptures by diuers Arguments. Firſt, by the matter whereof ſhe was made, <hi>being</hi>

Thirdly, by the time and order of the Creation, 1. <hi>Tim. 2. 12, 13. I permit not a woman to take authoritie ouer the man; for</hi> ADAM <hi>was firſt formed, and then</hi> EVE. Fourthly, By <note n="f" place="margin">Gen. 2. 23.</note>

                  </note> woman which he giueth, deriued from man, out of whom ſhee was taken.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, That of eyther ſexe hee created but one <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> and one <hi>Eue,</hi>
                  <note n="h" place="margin">Gen. 2. 21, 22.</note> whom hee ioyned in holy Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, for the propagation of Mankind.</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing to bee obſerued<note place="margin">Of nothing.</note>
                  <note place="margin">Thoſe that held all or ſome of the Creatures, whether Angels or the ſoules of men to bee made or traduced (as they call it) out of Gods owne eſſence.</note> is, <hi>ex quo,</hi> whereof they were made, <hi>viz.</hi> of nothing, onely by his mighty powerfull Word. <hi>So as the things wee ſee, were not made of things that doe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare,</hi> as the
<note n="i" place="margin">Heb. 11. 13.</note> Apoſtle ſaith to the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewes,</hi> that is, were made of nothing. <hi>By</hi> 
                  <note n="k" place="margin">Pſal. 33. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>the Word of</hi> IEHOVAH, as it is in the <hi>Pſalmes, the Heauens were made, and by the breath of his Mouth all the hoſt of them.</hi> So it is in the 148. <note n="l" place="margin">Pſal. 148. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>Pſalme, He commanded, and they were created.</hi> This appeareth euidently in the Hiſtory of the Creation, thorowout all the parts: <hi>God</hi>

                  <hi>ſaid, Let there bee Light, and there was Light:</hi> And ſo in the reſt. God therefore needed not (as ſilly men doe) ſtuffe or matter to worke vpon; hee needed not tooles or other inſtruments, neyther vſed hee the ayde or helpe of any Aſſiſtant; as the
<note n="n" place="margin">Eſay 40. 13.</note> Prophet teacheth vs, when hee cryeth out, <hi>Who holpe the Spirit of</hi> IEHOVAH? <hi>or as a man of his counſell gaue him Knowledge?</hi> And this being againſt the courſe of nature, and contrary to the beaten axiome of all Philoſophie, <hi>that of nothing it is impoſſible a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing ſhould come,</hi> is worthily made a fruit of Faith for men to beleeue; the <note n="o" place="margin">Heb. 11. 3.</note> Apoſtle bearing witneſſe, <hi>that by faith onely wee vnderſtand it:</hi> for howſoeuer many of the Heathen who knew not God, eſpecially the wiſer ſort, haue in a kinde acknowledged a Creation: Neyther in truth can any bee ſo blockiſh, as not to ſee it, if he looke but vp to Heauen, and the frame of this World, which haue the name of their Workeman and Creatour written in their fore-head: yet neuer was there any, not ſo much
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:29324:55"/> as the wiſeſt of them, that could attaine to this, How the World ſhould bee made of nothing. Heere therefore all reaſon of man muſt ſtoope, and bee content to learne of him, in whoſe Schoole it is better to bee Schollers, then Teachers and Profeſſors any where beſides; who not onely maketh men wiſer then the beaſts of the field, as it is in the

               <p>Thirdly, I note the order and manner how all this was effected.</p>
               <p>Firſt, The Angels, and their World, the higheſt Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens, were without more adoe immediately made of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: But for men and the World which here we ſee, it was ſomewhat in another ſort.</p>
               <p>For touching the World it ſelfe:</p>
               <p>Firſt, God minding to erect ſuch a large and goodly Theater, wherein hee would make full demonſtration of his incomparable both Power, Wiſedome and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
<note n="q" place="margin">Gen. 1. 1, 2.</note> framed firſt an empty an vnſhapen lumpe, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out faſhion, without forme, called Waters, for the vaſt hugeneſſe of it; Darkneſſe for the confuſion and lacke of forme; <hi>and the Deepe,</hi> for the emptineſſe without bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome to reſt vpon, which, leſt it ſhould vaniſh and come to nothing, hauing no ſteaddineſſe to vphold it, the Spirit of God lay vpon it, and ouer-ſpred it, to keepe it from decay.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Out of this lumpe and vnformed confuſion did God afterwards diſtinctly forme this World, and all the parts of it. Firſt, thoſe foure Elements, called the ſimple bodies, by fetching one contrary out of another, as Light out of Darkneſſe, the Firmament out of empti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, dry Earth out of Waters: then the compound bodies out of the ſame Elements, and for the moſt part, of all foure vnequally mingled together, euery one princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally

As from God, that is, goodneſſe it ſelfe, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can come but abſolutely good. For the further ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling vp of which Doctrine, wee haue the teſtimony of God himſelfe, both in euery ſpeciall: <hi>God</hi>

                  <hi>looked vpon all that hee had made, and behold, it was exceeding good.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This goodneſſe in the Creatures generally, is the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie of perfection, according to that their nature is capable of: for goodneſſe in that place, is not to bee ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken as oppoſite vnto vice, and to that foule deformitie, which is a breach of the righteous Law of God: but it noteth that perfection and excellency of eſtate, that eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Creature was framed in, according as his nature was fit and able to receiue. No weakneſſe or infirmitie was then any where to be ſeene. No corruption or decay, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing out of frame or ioynt ſo, as now wee ſee the whole

<note n="b" place="margin">Gen. 1. 26, 27 Epheſ. 4. 24. Coloſſ. 3. 10. 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Cor. 3. 18.</note> after which man is ſaid to bee created. But all this, as I ſaid before, is to be vnderſtood according to that their nature is capable of; for</p>
               <p>Firſt, The Angels are capable of a farre more excellent perfection then mans nature can attayne.</p>
               <p>Seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dly, Not onely euery nature is not capable of eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry grace, but there is no Creature that can be eyther per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly ſingle, infinite, or vnchangeable, which are the proper Prayſe of GOD: for euen thoſe heauenly Spirits haue ſome things mixed and compounded in them, and being of finite nature, are not capable of infinite Power, Wiſedome, Holineſſe, or other graces, nor any way can come neere the excellencie of the Creator. Beſide, both Men and Angels were framed of a mutable and change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able diſpoſition, the more to ſet out that conſtant and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable nature which is in God: and therefore alſo of a nature both ſubiect to temptation, ſuch as eyther their owne thoughts, or outward obiects may offer to them, and of a will, though free, able to chooſe good, and to leaue euill: yet inclinable aſwell to euill as to good, though in their eſtate of holineſſe, moſt vnto good. <hi>Iob 15. 15. Behold, he putteth no ſtedfaſtneſſe in his Saints.</hi> And <hi>Iob 4. 8. Behold, hee putteth no ſtedfaſtneſſe in his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Angels Holineſſe I call the integritie of their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:29324:57"/> being firſt enlightened with the perfect knowledge<note place="margin">Holineſſe, in a mind enlighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with the knowledge of the whole will of God: &amp; all the ſtrength of nature con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</note> of the will of God, and of his moſt holy Law, written and engrauen in their minde by nature.

               <p>Happineſſe is all that good, that can poſſibly fall vpon the Creature.<note place="margin">Happineſſe, in the fruition of Gods loue, and (from thence com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming) a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunction and communion with him.

               </p>
               <p>It ſtandeth in three things:</p>
               <p>Firſt, The loue of God vpon vs: who is good it ſelfe, and the chiefe and onely good, from whence commeth all the good of Men and Angels.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The enioying of his gracious preſence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alwayes with him, and ſeeing him face to face.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, A communion and participation, in ſome ſort, ſo farre as our nature can receiue of all thoſe excellencies that are in him, communicable to his Creatures.</p>
               <p>Our Sauiour, as we heard before, reckoneth them all, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. in the concluſion of the Lords Prayer, King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, Power, Glory.</p>
               <p>Of his Kingdome wee participate, by the dominion and ſoueraigntie which hee giueth vs ouer the other Creatures.</p>
               <p>Of his Power, by hauing ſtrength of nature, and abilitie to exerciſe this ſoueraigntie, and to put it in execution.</p>
               <p>Of his Glory, in being full of excellencie within and without.

                  <hi>Reuelation,</hi> it is ſaid of that moſt foule Apoſtacie, that <hi>God had put into their heart, with one conſent to giue their power to the Beaſt. Gen. 45. 8.

Him you haue taken by the fore-determined counſell and fore-knowledge of God, and nayled vpon the Croſſe.</hi> And <note n="u" place="margin">Acts 4. 28.</note> againe, HEROD <hi>and</hi> PONTIVS PI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LATE, <hi>with the Gentiles and people of Iſrael, aſſembled together to doe whatſoeuer thy hand and thy counſell had fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>determined to bee done. 2. Sam. 12. 11. Thus ſaith</hi> IEHO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VAH, <hi>I will raiſe vp euill againſt thee out of thine owne houſe, and taking thy Wiues before thine eyes, will giue them to thy fellow, who ſhall lye with them before this Sunne; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though thou haſt done it priuily, yet will I doe this thing openly before all Iſrael, and before this Sunne.</hi> The contrary Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of this, making God an idle beholder, or a naked permitter, without hauing any ſtroke in theſe ſinfull acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, for the ruling and diſpoſing of them, taketh away from him almoſt the whole glorie of the gouernement of the World: for firſt, the Deuils can doe nothing elſe but ſinne: Therefore if God ſhould haue no ſtroke in wicked actions his Prouidence could not extend to them. Among men, the <note n="x" place="margin">Epheſ. 2. 2.</note> Reprobate alwayes, and Gods Elect, till they be regenerate, are wholly led by the ſway and ſwindge of Satan: yea, the Regenerate themſelues, in how many things doth he carrie them? as he did <hi>Dauid,</hi> to Murder, and Adulterie; <hi>Lot</hi> to Inceſt; <hi>Noah</hi> to Drunkenneſſe, &amp;c. And the beſt of all their actions are ſtayned with ſome corruption that is his, and commeth from him.</p>
               <p>But is not God hereby made the Authour of ſinne? God forbid. The <hi>Manichees</hi> indeed, when they knew not how otherwiſe to excuſe him, plunged themſelues into a foule and monſtrous abſurditie: for they made two
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:29324:63"/> beginnings of things; God, from whom all goodneſſe commeth, and the Deuill, from whom all euill, or (which is all one) two gods, a good and an euill god. This is a horrible and a fearefull Blaſphemie, and ſtriketh at the verie roote of all Religion. But for auoyding all danger that may grow hereby, it is neceſſarie, firſt, to know how and in what ſence wee ſay, that God hath a ſtroke in vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous and ſinfull actions; not becauſe he inſtilleth or powreth into his Creatures a poyſon which before they had not; or inclineth them vnto wickedneſſe: (for that were indeed to make God the authour of ſinne) but part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in that hee forſaketh and leaueth them to their owne naturall corruption, either by taking away the grace they had, or not beſtowing new grace which they want, whereby they runne head-long vnto euill: partly, that he letteth Satan looſe vpon them, to bee by him blinded and miſſe-led, becauſe they haue refuſed to be ruled and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned by Gods Word and Spirit. To the former, thoſe places are to be referred, where he is ſaid to tempt or try them, as the Holy Ghoſt recordeth <note n="y" place="margin">2.

<pb n="90" facs="tcp:29324:64"/> IEHOVAH <hi>hath ſent a lying ſpirit into the mouth of all thy Prophets.</hi> And the 1. <hi>Sam. 16. 15, 16. An euill ſpirit from</hi> IEHOVAH <hi>vexed</hi> SAVL. And that nothing herein falleth from the holineſſe and Iuſtice of the Lord; as all men not forſaken of common ſence, doe eaſily diſcerne (for elſe, as the
<note n="e" place="margin">Rom. 3. 6.</note> Apoſtle reaſoneth, how ſhould God iudge the World?) So the Holy Ghoſt in many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces teacheth very plainly; for when the
<note n="f" place="margin">
                     <hi>Hoſh.</hi> 13 9:</note> Prophet cryeth out, <hi>Thy deſtruction is from thy ſelfe, O Iſrael:</hi> doth it not follow of neceſſitie, that the cauſe alſo of deſtruction, which is ſinne, is wholly from our ſelues, and that GOD hath no part in it? Which <note n="g" place="margin">Iames 1. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>Iames</hi> more plainly vttereth, <hi>Let no man, when he is tempted, ſay, I am tempted of God: for God cannot be tempted of euill, neither tempteth he any man.</hi> And 1. <hi>Iohn</hi> 2. <note n="h" place="margin">1. Iohn 2. 15.</note> 
                  <hi>Whatſoeuer is in the World, as the luſt of the fleſh, and the luſt of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not from the Father, but is from the World.</hi> For this cauſe ſinne is called. The <note n="i" place="margin">1. Iohn 3. 8. he that committeth ſinne, is of the Deuill, for the Deuill ſinneth from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. For this cauſe was the Sonne of God manifeſted, that he might deſtroy the worke of the Deuill.</note> worke of the <hi>Deuill.</hi> And our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Chriſt ſaith, <hi>When</hi> 
                  <note n="k" place="margin">Iohn 8. 44.</note> 
                  <hi>he ſpeaketh a lye, hee ſpeaketh of his owne.</hi> The ſinne therefore of the Action, is wholly to bee aſcribed to the depraued nature and corruption of men, wherein God is no way to be blamed,
<note n="l" place="margin">Eccleſ. 7. 29.</note> 
                  <hi>Who made all righteous, but they haue ſought many inuentions to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues.</hi> To illuſtrate this by one or two Similitudes; Hee that ſpurreth a lame Horſe, is the cauſe of his ſtirring, but not of his halting. The Sunne that ſhineth vpon a filthie carcaſſe, maketh the ſauor, yet it is no cauſe of any ſtench: for out of ſweete Flowres it bringeth a pleaſant odour. Such is the worke of God in the actions of wicked men.</p>
               <p>And the better to apprehend how God in all this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayneth without any touch of ſinne, wee muſt conſider that ſinne hath alwayes three things going with it, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of it is impoſſible that any one ſhould fall vpon God.</p>
               <p>Firſt, To bee ſubiect to a Law: <hi>For</hi> 
                  <note n="m" place="margin">Rom. 5. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>where no law is, there is no tranſgreſſion.</hi> And the <note n="n" place="margin">1. Iohn 3. 4.</note> Apoſtle defineth ſinne <hi>to bee a breach of the Law.</hi> Now God, who made his
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:29324:64"/> Lawes for others, is not himſelfe to bee tyed to them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Impuritie and corruption, a thing moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to the nature of God, who is not onely holy and pure, but holineſſe and puritie it ſelfe, and ſo farre off from being euill, that he <note n="o" place="margin">Iames 1. 13.</note> cannot be tempted of it.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, An euill and a wicked end. Whereas GOD euermore ſeeketh his owne glorie, which is abſolutely good, and the chiefe Good of all. Therefore beſide that the will of God is the Rule of all goodneſſe, the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in theſe ſinfull actions betweene that hee worketh, and the worke of wicked men, lyeth plaine, aſwell in the cauſe that mooueth him, as in the end hee ſetteth before him: and in the manner of doing all which, though they bee in reſpect of wicked men vniuſt and ſinfull, yet as they proceede from God, they are moſt iuſt and holy; for firſt, by reaſon of this diuerſitie of the cauſes moouing, and of the diuers ends which theſe two Agents, God and wicked men, ſet before them, it falleth out, that the ſelfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſame Action, which, in reſpect of the corruption of wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men, becommeth vnto them ſinfull and damnable, is as in regard of God moſt holy and righteous, being led thereto for moſt gracious and iuſt reſpects; either to ſet forth the riches of his Iuſtice or Mercie, or for the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtizement and tryall of his Children, or for ſome other cauſe, as he ſeeth good: which ends the wicked neuer ſet before them, but all the contrarie; what more bleſſed or glorious worke, and of greater loue to vs was there euer, or can poſſibly be, then the reconciling of the World by the death of his Sonne? And what more iuſt, in reſpect of God, then to inflict all theſe puniſhments vpon him, who was our ſuretie, and tooke vpon him the ſinnes of all the Elect, to ſatisfie for them by his ſufferings? Whereof ſo holy and good it was, as comming from God, both in reſpect of the cauſes, ends, matter, and manner of doing, yet iuſtly doth the Holy <note n="p" place="margin">Acts 2. 23.</note> Ghoſt call them <hi>wicked hands,</hi> by whom hee was nayled to the Croſſe. <hi>And</hi> worthily
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:29324:65"/> did <hi>Iudas</hi> receiue <hi>ſtrangling</hi> 
                  <note n="q" place="margin">Acts 1. 16. 17.</note> 
                  <hi>and the ſheading forth of his bowels, as the reward of his iniquitie, for being guide to thoſe that apprehended Ieſus.</hi> They doing it to a wicked end, &amp; after a ſinfull manner, not as an act of Iuſtice, but of Treaſon and Rebellion againſt God, out of the maliciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of their corrupt natures. And that which is ſaid of this, may by the iudicious Reader be eaſily fitted, and applyed to the Examples following. So it was a ſingular worke of mercie, to ſend <hi>Ioſeph</hi> into the Land of Egypt, to bee a Father to his Fathers houſe, at that time the onely viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Church of God, <hi>to prouide</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Secondly, theſe euill actions, as in regard of the worke of God, are holy and righteous: for that which is a point of Iuſtice and morall good, he thereby puniſheth former ſinnes, and one wickedneſſe with another, deliuering them vp, like a righteous Iudge, to the luſt and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of their owne heart; and to Satans power, as to the Seriants and Executioners of his wrath; that ſo they ſhould be tempted and led into new ſinnes, for the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of their old, and by both may aggrauate their condemnation.</p>
               <p>This is it which he himſelfe ſaith, <hi>Pſal. 81. 13. Becauſe my People harkened not to my voyce, nor Iſrael would none of mee, therefore diſmiſſed I them to the fancie of their owne heart, to walke after their owne counſell.</hi> And the Apoſtle to the

Likewiſe alſo the male, leauing the naturall vſe of the woman, burned in their luſt one towards another, Males with Males committing filthineſſe, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing in themſelues the recompence which was meete for their errour.

So it is in <note n="t" place="margin">Iob 12. 20.</note> IOB: <hi>Hee weakeneth the ſtrong Loine.</hi> And of the Egyptians <hi>Eſay</hi>
                  <note n="u" place="margin">Eſay 19. 3.</note> propheſieth, <hi>Their ſpirit ſhall bee ſpent in the middeſt of them,</hi> being quite out of heart. Thus and diuerſly beſide God doth worke, diſpoſing ſo of euery thing, as beſt may ſerue to worke &amp; effect his counſels.</p>
               <p>In one or two Examples all this may be verie manifeſt; God had determined to adua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce <hi>Ioſeph</hi> aboue his Brethren, and to make him the father of his fathers houſe. See how he maketh all things to concurre hereunto: Hee vſeth firſt his owne Brethrens malice, after long conſulation of taking away his life: in the end, to reſolue to ſell him into Egypt. Being there, hee openeth him a way into <hi>Potiphers</hi> houſe, a chiefe Ruler about the King: through whoſe wiues inordinate luſt and forged complaint, hee is
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:29324:71"/> vniuſtly throwne into Chaines, and in Priſon findeth fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour with his Keeper, committing into his hands the charge of all the Priſoners. The ſame time God brought into that place two of the Kings chiefe Officers, his But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler and his Baker, for their offences committed, thither. By their Dreames, his knowledge and skill in the interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of hidden things commeth to bee knowne. After which, God himſelfe ſheweth to the King a Famine that was to come; but in a Dreame darke and obſcure, which onely <hi>Ioſeph</hi> was able to expound. By this meanes the Butler calling him to remembrance, when now hee ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med vtterly to be forgotten, he is ſent for, and preſented to the King: And by the wiſdome which God had giuen him, declaring the Dreame, and aduiſing the beſt meanes in policie to preuent it, is made Ruler ouer the whole Land. The Famine increaſing, his Brethren firſt are dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen into Egypt, and there vnwittingly doe him homage. After, his whole fathers houſe came to be fed by him; and ſo fulfill that which the Lord had purpoſed. See how hee maketh theſe things one to hang vpon another, that in the middeſt of the moſt contingent Actions, his counſels ſhould yet haue a neceſſary effect. Take another Example out of the Booke of <hi>Eſter,</hi> of the confounding of proud <hi>Haman,</hi> the enemie of the Iewes, and defeating of his cruell and wicked purpoſes againſt the Church, by the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uorce of <hi>Vaſhti</hi> the Queene. God maketh a way for the lifting vp of ESTER (<hi>not knowne</hi> to bee a Iew) into her roome. <hi>Mordecai</hi> hee gouerneth, to bee preſent when the Kings two Courtiers conſpired againſt him; which by <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters</hi> meanes was ſignified to the King, they executed, and a perpetuall record made of all this in the memoriall of thoſe times. When <hi>Haman</hi> had obtayned an inuiolable Edict (as were the Decrees of the Medes and Perſians, neuer to bee reuoked) for the rooting out of the Iewes, and to beginne with, had prepared a Gallowes of fiftie Cubits high, to hang vp <hi>Mordecai</hi> a chiefe and a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:29324:72"/> man among them; the verie night before this miſchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous plot ſhould haue beene executed, God kept the Kings eyes reſtleſſe, that all ſleepe departed from him, and calling for the Chronicles, Gods ſecret Prouidence dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted him to the place where <hi>Mordecaies</hi> fact was regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred. Thereupon willing to doe him honour, he comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth <hi>Haman</hi> that came at the ſame inſtant, with a minde to hang vp <hi>Mordecai,</hi> to bee the man to doe him ſeruice. By that meanes God abated <hi>Hamans</hi> pride, diſappointed his cruell practices, and finally giuing <hi>Eſter</hi> fauour in the Kings ſight, made her ſute more gracious, ſo as not onely <hi>Haman</hi> tooke ſeiſin of the Gallowes, which <hi>Mordecai</hi> ſhould haue beene hanged vpon; but her owne and her peoples life were giuen vnto her at her requeſt, and that, with libertie to exerciſe dominion vpon their Enemies which would haue tyrannized ouer them. <hi>Mordecai,</hi> or whoſoeuer was the Writer of that Storie, penning it (as wee may coniecture) not onely for the Church, but as a Monument to bee laid vp among the Records and Yeere-bookes of the Perſians, who would neuer haue abidden ſo religious an obſeruation of the Prouidence of God, as the courſe of that action worthily required, doth not in words much inſiſt vpon it, (as for the ſame cauſe it may be thought that hee forbeareth ſo much as to mention the Name of God in all that Booke): But for the thing it ſelfe, there is no doubt, he giueth particularly and moſt nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to bee obſerued the hand of God in euery circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. But how euident is all this to be ſeene in the Birth of our Sauiour Chriſt, who, as the Prophet, many an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred yeere before, had propheſied, was to bee borne at <hi>Bethlem</hi> the Citie of <hi>Dauid?</hi> This how wonderfully God brought about, it is a maruell to behold <hi>Marie</hi> his Mother, as it ſeemeth, forgetting, and not ſo much as once thinking of it, when the Holy Ghoſt had ouer-ſhaddowed her, that ſhe conceiued and was with child, ſhe yet dwelt at <hi>Nazareth</hi> a Citie of Galile, farre from the Towne of
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:29324:72"/> 
                  <hi>Bethlem;</hi> there ſhee continued, and there, as by the Storie wee may gather, ſhee meant to bee deliuered. Her time drawing neere that ſhee was euen readie to lye downe, there commeth an Edict from the Emperour <hi>Auguſtus</hi> (minding onely his owne glorie, and the increaſe of his Treaſures) that all the World ſhould bee taxed, euery one in their owne Citie: ſo as <hi>Mary</hi> being of the Houſe and Lineage of <hi>Dauid,</hi> was inforced againſt her will to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>payre vnto <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> there to be taxed with her kindred, intending nothing leſſe then that which fell out after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; for it is expreſly noted, that ſhee went with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther minde, to obey the Edict of <hi>Caeſar:</hi> but contrarie to her purpoſe, God fulfilled his, by leading her, as it were blind-fold, to the place where Chriſt ſhould bee borne. And ſo His counſell tooke effect, where all counſell of man did faile.</p>

But albeit whatſoeuer God willeth muſt moſt certainly and neceſſarily come to paſſe, becauſe hee willeth it, yet that taketh not away the freedome of will in the reaſonable Creature, nor the nature and propertie of the ſecond cauſes, but only bends them to runne that way that he hath fore-determined; they, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this neceſſitie, not being compelled to doe that which God determineth, but freely willing that which is done by them: So that if wee referre the action to GODS will, which is the ſupreme cauſe of all, it may be ſaid neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie; if to mans will, it may bee ſaid contingent and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarie. And thereupon effects and euents of things are termed ſuch as the ſecond cauſes are neceſſarie: If they be neceſſarie, contingent; if they be contingent, voluntarie; if the ſecond cauſes be voluntarie, although in reſpect of Gods Decree all bee neceſſarie.

<pb n="113" facs="tcp:29324:75"/> might both ſee, behold, admire, and confeſſe the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie thereof, aſwell in themſelues as others; without which, all the other Creatures and Actions of God, how infinite matter ſoeuer they containe of Gods Glory, could no whit increaſe his prayſe, which was the end of his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerning, and making of them, no more then all the skill and excellencie of the moſt perfect workman can purchaſe credit or commendation of his worke, if none but him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe obſerue it. Therefore in his wiſdome he ſaw it need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to create Men and Angels, indued with knowledge, iudgement, a reaſonable ſoule and will, and other excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent parts, to be the Trumpetters of his Glorie. But not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding that in theſe God could glorifie himſelfe, though men and Angels would ſtop their mouthes, and conſpire to roote it out, hee being able either to deſtroy the Creatures he had made, and ſo to glorifie his Power and Iuſtice in their deſerued ruine, or againſt their will to wring from them a confeſſion of his Prayſe; yet as earthly Princes not onely deſire Soueraigntie and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, which the Rebels themſelues are not able to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw, but loue eſpecially that their people ſhould obey &amp; carrie Subiectly mindes vnto them: So it pleaſed God to adde this one vnto the reſt, for the full making vp and perfecting of his glorie.</p>
               <p>This honour we define by the doing of his will, which is the proper office of Angels and Men, and not of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Creature: yet it is true, the reſt of the Creatures doe the will of God alſo: yea, the wicked aſwell as the good, but not in the ſame manner. The wicked doe it, becauſe they ſhall doe it, will they nill they: Gods Children, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they haue a will and deſire to doe it. Generally, all doe his will and pleaſure, that is, <note n="f" place="margin">Pſal. 115. 3. &amp; 135. 6.</note> whatſoeuer hee in his euerlaſting counſell hath purpoſed to be done. But that is the ſecret and hidden will of God, which the wicked may doe and periſh; not his knowne and reuealed will, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of wee heere ſpeake, which cannot bee done but in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:29324:76"/> of reaſonable Creatures; to the doing whereof a promiſe is belonging. This diſtinction of a ſecret and a reuealed will of God, <hi>Moſes</hi> teacheth, <hi>Deut. 29. 30. The hidden things belong to</hi> IEHOVAH <hi>our God: but the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed things to vs and our children, to doe all the words of the Law.</hi> Howbeit, for all that, they are not two wils, but one will, as God himſelfe is one.</p>
               <p>The doctrine which thus reuealeth and ſetteth forth his will, is called the Law of God, commanding vs in all things to ſerue and pleaſe him. The contrary whereof is ſinne, being a breach of the Law; as the Apoſtle doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine it, 1. <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 4. And this law, I ſay, is giuen to the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Creature, not onely men, but Angels alſo, reſpect being had vnto their nature, which neither admitteth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that are to be done by the inſtrument of the bodie, nor is tyed to the things that belong to the neceſſities of this life. But that the Angels are bound to the obſeruati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Law, our Sauiour would haue vs learne, when he willeth vs to pray, <hi>Thy will be done, as in Heauen, ſo vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Earth.</hi>

Firſt, it muſt be of all duties, without failing in any one; doing all good, and abſtayning from all euill. Therefore perfection, which is a thorough doing of all, without fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of any whit, is the general vertue of the whole Law of God. Contrariwiſe, the failing in any one iot, either of the matter or the manner, is a breach of all. <note n="g" place="margin">Gal. 3. 10.</note>

               <p>Againe, all theſe things (not onely in the Seruice of God, but in the duties wee owe to men) wee muſt doe as vnto God, becauſe it is his good will and pleaſure<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

And that all concupiſcence is vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, euen that whereunto no conſent of the will doth come, may appeare by theſe reaſons following.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Becauſe the Root, from whence the leaſt thought doth ſpring, is naught, our owne inborne corruption: elſe it could neuer enter into vs, farther then by Satans offering it to the ſences and outward obiects, as it was to our Sauiour Chriſt, and to our firſt parents in their inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie. The ſinne whereof appeareth in this, that wee thinke not vpon it with a deteſtation at the firſt: but when it hath once paſſed our thoughts, then we beginne to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt it; which in the vncorrupt eſtate of man, ſhould haue beene quite contrary.</p>

Euen ſo concupiſcence, which is the ſpawne of ſinne, the bed and boſome where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it is conceiued and hatched, muſt needes it ſelfe bee ſinne; euen after Baptiſme, after wee bee regenerate, and after that the guilt and the ſting thereof is pulled out by Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Philoſophers and other heathen men, that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer heard of the Law of God, haue condemned ſettled purpoſes to doe euill. Therefore this muſt needs bee more cloſe and ſecret, which <hi>Paul</hi> himſelfe, ſo great a Doctor of the Law, brought vp at the feet of <hi>Gamaliel,</hi> was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together ignorant of, till he was taught a better Leſſon in the Schoole of Chriſt: <hi>I</hi>

               <p>Secondly, Doing outward duties not with a right mind to glorifie God, or to edifie their Brethren, but for out ward pompe and oſtentation, and to be ſeene of men: As our Sauiour ſpeaketh, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. 5. &amp; doth particularly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance <note n="u" place="margin">Mat. 6. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.</note> elſe-where in all the duties they performe, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Prayer and Faſting vnto God-wards, or giuing of Almes vnto the poore.</p>

               <p>Watchfulneſſe ſtandeth vpon two parts: The firſt is, that which preuents all occaſions of doing ill, and this is, as it were, a fence or hedge ſet round about, to guard Gods Commandements, that like wilde beaſts we ſhould not breake in vpon them.</p>
               <p>The woman, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 3. had learned this Leſſon, and held it forth at the firſt valiantly, as a weapon of great ſtrength to repell Satans forces, when ſhee expoundeth the Commandement <note n="i" place="margin">Gen. 2. 17.</note>

               </p>
               <p>Now wee muſt not thinke that this perfection here ſpoken of, is required of all alike: for euen among men it is iuſt, <note n="i" place="margin">Luke 12. 48.</note> to whom more is committed; of him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire more. The holineſſe and perfection of the Angels farre exceeded the holineſſe and perfection of <hi>Adam,</hi> according as their nature was more excellent and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. <hi>Adam</hi> 
                  <note n="k" place="margin">1. Tim. 3. 6.</note> alſo excelled <hi>Eue,</hi> who as the weaker Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, euen then when ſhee ſtood in her integritie, was firſt aſſailed by the cunning and ſlight of Satan: and both <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eue,</hi> if they had ſtill continued in the ſtate of Innocencie, by time and experience of Gods good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, ſhould haue beene better confirmed and growne more and more in heauenly Graces, as our
<note n="l" place="margin">Luke 2. 52.</note> Sauiour did; ſo in men growne, and publike perſons, more is required then in children or priuate men.</p>
               <p>The laſt thing is, that as our minde, ſoule and bodie,<note place="margin">Euery thing, with ſo much the greater ſtrength, as the dutie doth more excell.</note> and all the ſtrength of them muſt bee carryed both in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and action, to the performance of all good duties: ſo it muſt bee to euery one in his degree and place: For a difference of duties muſt of neceſſitie bee holden: the Commandements are ſome greater then other, and in euery Commandement ſome duties to bee preferred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the reſt.</p>
               <p>For example: the duties of the firſt Table are grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then the duties of the ſecond, which beſides the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe words of our Sauiour Chriſt, <hi>calling it the</hi>
                  <note n="m" place="margin">Mat. 22. 37.</note> 
                  <hi>firſt &amp; the great Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement,</hi> may be ſhewed out of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:29324:89"/> firſt, and then out of the Apoſtle, who both make the breach of the firſt Table, to bee the cauſe that men runne head-long into all offences againſt the ſecond. <hi>Vpon</hi> 
                  <note n="n" place="margin">Hoſh. 4. 12.</note> 
                  <hi>the tops of the Mountaines they ſacrifice, and vpon the hils; they offer burnt offerings vnder the Oke, and Poplar, and Oliue, becauſe the ſhaddow therof is good. Therefore doe your daughters commit fornication, and your daughters in Law goe a whoring. And therefore</hi> 
                  <note n="o" place="margin">Rom. 1. 25, 26 28, 29.</note> 
                  <hi>God gaue them vp to their owne hearts luſt, vnto vncleanneſſe, to defile their owne bodies betweene themſelues; which turned the Truth of God into a Lye, and worſhipped the Creatures, forſaking the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator who is bleſſed for euer. For this cauſe God gaue them vp to vile affections, vnrighteouſneſſe, fornication, &amp;c.</hi> The duties of the firſt Table are greater then the ſecond, as they are in order before them.</p>
               <p>And this is abſolutely true, comparing like degrees, as morall duties of the one, with morall duties of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, not ceremoniall of the firſt Table, with the Morall of the ſecond: for in that caſe it is true which the <note n="p" place="margin">Hoſh. 6. 6.</note> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſpeaketh, <hi>I am delighted with Mercie, and not with Sacrifice.</hi> So the chiefe, middle and leaſt duties of the firſt Table, are to be compared with the like of the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, deedes with deedes, words with words, thoughts with thoughts, &amp; not otherwiſe: for if you co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pare Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der with the leaſt abuſe of the Name of God, or Adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie with the leaſt breach of the Sabbath, theſe are the greater ſinnes.</p>
               <p>For the meaſure and proportion to bee obſerued in this difference;</p>
               <p>Firſt, in the ſeruice of God, our nature ought to bee more prone, and apt vnto it, our knowledge greater, our iudgement riper, our conſcience tenderer, our memorie freſher, our deſires and will earneſter, all things to bee done with a greater Affection, Loue, Approbation, Cheerefulneſſe, Feare to offend, Sinceritie, Zeale, Watchfulneſſe, and continuance both in Profeſſion and
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:29324:89"/> Action. In which regard, to ſhew how all our Thoughts, Deſires, and Affections ſhould thus bee taken vp, when we come to deale with God, it is ſaid, <hi>Thou</hi>
                  <note n="q" place="margin">Mat. 22.</note> 
                  <hi>ſhalt loue the Lord with all thine heart, and with all thy ſoule, and with all thy ſtrength:</hi> As if this were proper to the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the firſt Table, which indeed doth but principally belong to them, and is by proportion to bee carryed to the reſt. Therefore the glorie of God ought to be dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer vnto vs, then the ſauing of our owne ſoules: As the examples of <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> doe teach vs;
<note n="r" place="margin">Exod. 32. 32.</note> one deſiring to be blotted out of the Booke of Life, rather then that Gods great Name ſhould be blaſphemed amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles: The
<note n="ſ" place="margin">Rom. 9. 3.</note> other, for the glorifying of God in the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of his Brethren the Nation of the Iewes, wiſhing to be <hi>anathema,</hi> accurſed from Chriſt. But eſpecially Chriſt himſelfe, as a moſt abſolute and perfect example of all righteouſneſſe, doth herein goe before vs; when the houre being come wherein hee was for our ſakes to drinke vp the full cup of the fierce wrath of his Father, and his ſoule perplexed, that he knew not which way to turne him, yet hee more regardeth the glorifying of God, then the ſauing of himſelfe from that houre, <hi>Now</hi> 
                  <note n="t" place="margin">Ioh. 12. 27, 28</note> 
                  <hi>is my ſoule troubled.</hi> And <hi>What ſhall I ſay? Father, ſaue me from this houre: but for that cauſe am I come vnto this houre. Father, glorifie thy Name.</hi> And hereupon it is, that in all our Prayers we are to ſet that in the firſt place, as our Sauiour by the verie order of his heauenly Prayer teacheth: ſo as if it could be imagined, that wee had no need to aske for our ſelues (which wee alwayes haue) yet the onely zeale of his glorie ought continually to ſtirre vs vp vnto this dutie: and that much more forcibly then all our owne neceſſities. The contrarie whereof is Loue of the Creature aboue God. <hi>He</hi>
                  <note n="u" place="margin">Mat. 10. 37.</note> 
                  <hi>that loueth fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or mother more then me, is not worthy of me. They</hi>

                  <hi>lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the prayſe of men, more then the praiſe of God.</hi> Whither belongeth the loue of our ſelues and of worldly plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:29324:90"/> of which kind of people the Apoſtle ſaith, <note n="y" place="margin">Philip. 3. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>Whoſe god is their belly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, When we come vnto our ſelues, the ſoule is to be reſpected before all worldly commodities. <note n="z" place="margin">Mat. 6. 33.</note> 
                  <hi>Seeke first the Kingdome of God and his righteouſneſſe, and all theſe things ſhall as appendices be caſt vnto you.</hi> So in ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall Graces, euery one as it is more excellent: <hi>Deſire</hi>
                  <note n="a" place="margin">1. Cor. 12. 31.</note> 
                  <hi>the beſt gifts, and I will ſhew you a more excellent way. Follow</hi>

                  <hi>after loue, and couet after ſpirituall gifts; but more, that ye may propheſie</hi> of outward things. <hi>The bodie is</hi> 
                  <note n="c" place="margin">Pro. 22. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>to be eſteemed more then rayment: a good name, more then great riches, and grace and fauour, better then ſiluer or gold.</hi> And therefore in the things that concerne our owne good, firſt, we are to aske thoſe that belong to the ſauing of our ſoules, and that without exception; next, the things for this preſent life, ſo farre as God ſeeth them to bee good for vs. The contrarie whereof, is that which the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of, <hi>Phil. 3. 19. To minde earthly things:</hi> and as he ſaith in
<note n="d" place="margin">1. Tim. 6. 5, 6, 9, 10.</note> another place, To imbrace godlineſſe, not for it ſelfe, but for lucres ſake.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Circumſtances alſo of time, place, perſon, and ſuch like, ought to inforce our ſtrength and powers. <hi>Paul,</hi> though he carryed himſelfe in all ſinceritie towards all, yet, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 12. profeſſeth, hee did it more aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly vnto them.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, In things that are indifferent, the leſſe and fewer circumſtances muſt yeeld to the more and greater; vpon this reaſon, <hi>Ezra</hi> being in a ſtraight, either to paſſe vnto Ieruſalem with danger of his owne life, and of theirs that went with him, or to giue the King occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to ſuſpect the truth which he had taught him, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred that rather; <hi>I was aſhamed</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>Ezra 8. 22. to aske of the King an Armie and Horſemen, to helpe vs against the enemie in the way, becauſe we had ſpoken to the King, ſaying, The hand of our God is vpon all them that ſeeke him in goodneſſe: But his power and his wrath is againſt all them that forſake him.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="143" facs="tcp:29324:90"/>
               <p>In reſpect of all theſe things that hitherto haue bin deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered, the Law of God is called the Moral Law: for there is a four-fold co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſideration of the Law of God. One as it is an abſolute and perfect comprehenſion of al duties what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer, whereupon it hath the name of the Morall Law. Another, as it is the Image &amp; Sampler, wherunto men &amp; Angels were created in all Wiſedome and Holineſſe at the beginning. And ſo it is properly termed <hi>the Law of Nature.</hi> The third, as it contayneth the couenant of workes. In which regard, <hi>Paul</hi> is wont for the moſt part to terme it <hi>the Law,</hi> and ſometimes <hi>the</hi>

                  <hi>Law of Workes.</hi> The laſt, as it is a rule and direction for renewed Holineſſe, or the workes of Grace and Sanctification. And in that ſence, <hi>Iohn</hi> calleth it <hi>the new Law or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, 1. Iohn</hi> 2. 8.</p>
               <p>But the Morall Law is it which here wee treate of, whereunto for the Reaſons afore-ſaid, theſe properties are aſcribed:</p>

                  <hi>I account all thine Ordinances right in all things.</hi> So doth <hi>Salomon</hi> proclayme in his <note n="i" place="margin">Pro. 4. 11.</note>

               </p>
               <p>Secondly, It is a good and a holy Law, as the Apoſtle to the <note n="k" place="margin">Rom. 12. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>Romanes</hi> calleth it, <hi>That good will of God.</hi> And DAVID,
<note n="l" place="margin">Pſal. 119. 39.</note> 
                  <hi>Thy Lawes are good.</hi> Being therefore good, it is in it ſelfe acceptable vnto God, and maketh thoſe that doe it, accepted to him. Whereupon the ſame Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle <note n="m" place="margin">Rom. 12. 2.</note> there calleth it, <hi>That acceptable will of God.</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwiſe ſinne <hi>peruerteth the ſtraight wayes of the Lord,</hi>
                  <pb n="144" facs="tcp:29324:91"/> as <hi>Peter ſpeaketh, Acts</hi> 13. 10. And therefore it is euill and naught. <hi>Know</hi> 
                  <note n="n" place="margin">Ier. 2. 19.</note> 
                  <hi>and ſee</hi> (ſaith IEREMIE) <hi>that it is an euill and bitter thing, that thou forſakeſt</hi> IEHOVAH. And this is the common Epithite which the Scripture gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth vnto ſinne, which being naught, maketh vs odious and hatefull vnto God: <note n="o" place="margin">Pro. 15. 26.</note> 
                  <hi>Euill thoughts are an abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to</hi> IEHOVAH. <hi>Thou</hi> 
                  <note n="p" place="margin">Pſal. 3. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>hateſt all the workers of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, It is a <note n="q" place="margin">Iam. 1. 25.</note> perfect Law, commanding all good, and forbidding all euill.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, It is an eternall Law, without limitation of time or place, giuing a moſt abſolute and perfect direction for all ages and times of the World, before and ſince the Fall, and binding to a perpetuall obſeruation of it. So in the <note n="r" place="margin">Reuel. 21. 27.</note> 
                  <hi>Reuelation</hi> wee finde, <hi>That no vncleane thing, nor which doth abomination or lyes, ſhal enter into the new Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem.</hi> And <hi>Paul</hi> telleth the
<note n="ſ" place="margin">Gal. 5. 21.</note> 
                  <hi>Galathians, They which doe ſuch things,</hi> (the workes of the fleſh there reckoned vp) <hi>ſhall not inherit the Kingdome of God:</hi> for which cauſe the definition not of Righteouſneſſe onely, but of euery Commandement is ſo fitted, as the ſame may be a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall rule to ſerue all times and perſons whatſoeuer: for albeit ſome ſpeciall duties of certaine Commandements ſhall ceaſe when wee come to Heauen; yet the ſubſtance of euery one remayneth: there ſhall bee no Seuenth day ſet apart vnto Gods Seruice: for all Eternitie of time ſhall be taken vp for it, and a
<note n="t" place="margin">Heb. 4 9.</note> perpetuall Sabbath; no vſe of Marriage, but
<note n="u" place="margin">Mat. 22. 30.</note> puritie and perfection, like to the holy Angels. And the like is to be ſaid of the other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements: for ſeeing the Image of God, witneſſe the <note n="x" place="margin">Coloſſ. 3. 10. &amp; Epheſ. 4. 24.</note> Apoſtle, ſtandeth in Righteouſneſſe <hi>and Holineſſe,</hi> which are the two branches of the Law, it muſt needes tye vs with an euerlaſting loue, who were firſt made in that likeneſſe, and whoſe perfection in Heauen is to bee fully and perfectly renewed thereunto: which perpetuitie of the Morall Law was <note n="y" place="margin">Exod. 34. 27. 2 Cor. 3. 7.</note> noted, by ingrauing of it in ſtone.</p>
               <pb n="145" facs="tcp:29324:91"/>
               <p>But where, will you ſay, is this Doctrine of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe taught?</p>
               <p>Firſt, Nature it ſelfe doth teach it, in that by our firſt Creatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, we were made &amp; framed to the perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of it, &amp; yet retayn ſome notions therof in this our corrupt eſtate.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The Image of this Righteouſneſſe being in manner quite defaced and done away by the Fall of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> the ſame is, by the mercifull prouidence of GOD, for a more certaine direction of our wayes, and to hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble vs in ſeeing how ſhort we come of the performance of it, againe renewed, and the ſumme of all compendiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly abridged in ten Words, Sentences or Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, written <note n="z" place="margin">Exod. 34. 28.</note> by the finger of GOD in two Tables.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The ſame are expounded and handled more at large in the whole Volume of the Scripture, where all this Doctrine is fully and abſolutely taught. Of both thſe Lawes, the Law of Nature, and the written Law, the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, <hi>Rom. 2. 14, 15. For when the Gentiles which haue not a law, doe by nature the things of the Law theſe hauing not a law, are a law vnto themſelues, as thoſe which declare the worke of the Law written in their heart: their conſcience bearing record vnto themſelues, and their thoughts accuſing or excuſing them, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the vnderſtanding of thoſe ten Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and the better to diſcerne the large ſpread of Righteouſneſſe which they contayne, take theſe few Rules that hold in euery one.</p>
               <p>Firſt, They are vttered by a figuratiue ſpeech of a part for the whole, vnder one (and that commonly the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt) comprehending not onely euery particular dutie, whatſoeuer may fall into the life of man, of the ſame nature with that which is there commanded or forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, but the whole manner of performance, that it bee with all the powers of ones minde, ſoule and bodie; which belonging to euery Commandement, is once for all explayned in the definition I gaue of Righteouſneſſe.</p>
               <pb n="146" facs="tcp:29324:92"/>
               <p>Secondly, Commanding one thing, they forbid the contrarie: forbidding one thing, they command the contrarie. Laſtly, this withall is to be remembred, that all the things before ſpoken of in the definition I gaue Holineſſe and Righteouſneſſe, pertayne and haue their place in euery Commandement, the corruption of nature and deſire being (as I thinke) forbidden in euery one, not alone in the tenth:</p>
               <p>And that for theſe Reaſons:</p>
               <p>Firſt, From the nature of God that gaue the Law, who being a <note n="a" place="margin">Iohn 4. 24.</note> Spirit, &amp; therfore piercing <note n="b" place="margin">Heb. 4. 12, 13</note> into the moſt ſecret thoughts and intents of the heart, euery Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of his (not onely the ten Commandements layd together) muſt needes bee <note n="c" place="margin">Rom. 7. 14.</note> ſpirituall; to binde the whole ſtrength of nature, and all the thoughts and deſires which the Scripture is wont to call <hi>the ſpirit of our minde,</hi> as before was noted.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Since it cannot bee denyed, but that this is ſo in the duties of the firſt Table, the ſame reaſon and proportion carrieth it to thoſe of the ſecond alſo.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, our Sauiour Chriſts interpretation of the ſeuenth Commandement, is a ſufficient warrant, exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it to all kinde of Luſt, <hi>Math.</hi> 5. 28. As for the tenth, it hath another ſenſe, as ſhall be ſeene when we come vnto it. And that which <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Rom. 7. 7. I had not knowne luſt, except the Law had ſaid, Thou ſhalt not luſt:</hi> I take, vnder reformation of better iudgement, to be meant not of the tenth Commandement onely, but of the whole puritie that way, which the Law of God thorowout requireth, and that as well in the duties to God, as to our brethren; which the Apoſtle ſoundly ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thereth to be commanded in the Law, becauſe the Law is ſpirituall. Neither doth it follow, becauſe he ſaith, <hi>Except the Law had ſaid, Thou ſhalt not luſt,</hi> that therefore he muſt needs point out the very words of one Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement; or becauſe he ſaith many times (<hi>that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement</hi>)
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:29324:92"/> that therefore he meaneth a particular Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, one of the tenne: for the Law may as well be ſaid to ſay, <hi>Thou ſhalt not luſt,</hi> becauſe in the generall doctrine thereof it forbiddeth all kind of luſt, as in the like caſe the ſame Apoſtle
<note n="d" place="margin">Epheſ 5. 14.</note> writeth, <hi>that God ſaith in the Scripture, Ariſe, thou that ſleepeſt, and Chriſt ſhall ſhine vnto thee.</hi> Which notwithſtanding are not the precize words of any one place of Scripture, but the generall ſumme and doctrine of the Goſpell.</p>
               <p>The name alſo <hi>of Commandement,</hi> comprehending the ſcope and ſubſtance of many Commandements, you haue ſo vſed, 1. <hi>Iohn</hi> 2. 7, 8. And albeit <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 13. 9. doe aptly &amp; truly render the meaning of the tenth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, by the ſame very words which heere he v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, that hindereth not, but that in this place it may haue another ſence, the word ſeruing indifferently for <note n="e" place="margin">So is <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>The Tenne Commandements, which ſummarily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine the whole doctrine of Righteouſneſſe, whatſoeuer the Law or Prophets ſpeake of, our Sauiour Chriſt in his<note place="margin">The doing whereof is tearmed Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, and hath two parts, Pietio, and Iuſtice.</note> infinite wiſedome hath contriued into two: The loue of God, and of our brethren: When vnto the Lawyer, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king him which is the great Commandement in the Law, he anſwereth,
<note n="f" place="margin">Math. 22. 37.</note> 
                  <hi>Thou ſhalt loue the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy ſoule, and with all thy might. This is the firſt and great Commandement, and the ſecond is like vnto it: Thou ſhalt loue thy neighbour as thy ſelfe: on theſe two commandements hang the whole Law and the Prophets.</hi> PAVL vſeth the very termes of Pietie and Iuſtice, <hi>Rom. 1. 18. For the wrath of God is manifeſt from heauen againſt all impiety, and iniustice of men.</hi> So he ſaith, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 12. that the Grace of God manifeſted by the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell, inſtructeth vs, <hi>that wee ſhould liue ſoberly, and iustly, and godly in this preſent world.</hi> Where, before Iuſtice and

               <p>The ſumme of the firſt Table is, <hi>Thou ſhalt loue the Lord thy God with all thy heart</hi> (or minde) <hi>and with all thy ſoule, and with all thy might.</hi> And to this Table the foure firſt Commandements doe belong.

               <p>The ſumme of the firſt Commandement is, That wee<note place="margin">Pietie is, of the immediate du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to God; whereof this is the whole, that we haue God to be our God.</note> haue God to be our God. So it is expreſſed in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement it ſelfe, <hi>Thou ſhalt haue no other gods before my face.</hi> The firſt affirmatiue whereof is, <hi>Thou ſhalt haue me to be thy God.</hi> The contrary of this hauing of God to be our God, is, firſt, that which the Pſalmiſt <note n="o" place="margin">Pſal. 10 4.</note> noteth, <hi>The wicked are ſo proud, they ſeeke not after God.</hi> Againſt which, <note n="p" place="margin">2.

               <p>Secondly, to reuerence him for his Holineſſe, and the<note place="margin">Reuerencing.</note> Maieſty of his preſence, before whome no vnſeemely thing may come. <note n="b" place="margin">Eccleſ. 5. 1.</note>

               <p>Fourthly, Abuſing of the Creatures to the reading of Fortunes, Deſtinies, Prognoſtications, and ſuch like, contrarie to the right vſe and end of their Creation, which was not to fore-tell things to come, but to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh dayes, moneths and yeeres, as before was opened. Therefore doth the Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> worthily ſcorne and deride this kind of people, <hi>Eſay 47. 13. Thou tyreſt thy ſelfe with the multitude of thy counſels. Let now the Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logers,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:29324:101"/> the Star-gazers, and Prognoſticators ſtand vp, and ſaue thee from thoſe things that ſhall come vpon thee.</hi> In the particular parts of GODS Seruice theſe things are contrarie:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In Othes</hi> the contraries are, Firſt, to ſweare falſely: <hi>It</hi>
                  <note n="y" place="margin">Zach. 5. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>ſhall enter into the houſe of him that ſweareth falſely by my Name.</hi> Secondly, to ſweare of matters either not doubtfull or not of that waight that requireth an Othe, or when we know that he for whoſe ſake we ſweare, will not reſt in it. All theſe, the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 16. compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hendeth in one, when he ſaith, that an Othe among men for confirmation ſake, is <hi>an end of all gain-ſaying.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore Swearing in our common talke is vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full: <hi>Let</hi>

<note n="a" place="margin">Mat. 5. 37.</note> 
                  <hi>Thou ſhalt not forſweare thy ſelfe, but performe thine othe to the Lord.</hi> In Curſes it is contrarie, when in bitterneſſe or rage we curſe our enemies, or our ſelues: with which fault two <note n="b" place="margin">Iob 3. Ier. 35.</note> of the ſingular Saints of God, <hi>Iob</hi> and <hi>Ieremie</hi> were ſtayned.</p>
               <p>In Vowes. Firſt, When they are of<note place="margin">The Papiſts, which teach vows of things not in our own power, as perpetuall ſingle life.</note> things not in our power, whereby the vow of perpetuall ſingle life appeareth to be vnlawful: for as our Sauiour ſaith,
<note n="c" place="margin">Mat. 19. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>All are not capable of this, but they onely to whome it is giuen.</hi> Secondly, When wee vow things too baſe to offer vnto God; as if a Rich man, to obtayne ſome great mercie at Gods hands, would vow to giue ſomewhat not worth the ſpeaking of, vnto the poore. This <hi>Salomon</hi> wiſheth vs to take heed of, when in the matter of Vowes hee maketh the feare and reuerence of God, in not doing any thing vnworthy of his Maieſtie, one great and ſpeciall point, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 5. 6, 3. Thirdly, when we vow ſuch things, as are not indiffere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to do or to leaue vndone: for as <hi>to bring the
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:29324:101"/> hire of a Whore, or the price of a Dogge into the Houſe of God for a <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ow,</hi> were to prophane his Seruice, <hi>Deut.</hi> 23. 18. So to vow that in token of a rare and extraordinarie zeale, which without vow wee are bound to doe, is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to dally with God, then to offer any ſpeciall ſeruice to him. This is plainly taught, <hi>Deut.</hi> 23. 24. when it is ſaid, <hi>If thou vow not at all, it ſhall not be ſinne vnto thee:</hi> but the ſinne is, in not performing our Vow, when wee haue vowed it. And if wee take a view of all the Vowes of Gods Children, wee ſhall find them all for the moſt part (according vnto this rule) of things which otherwiſe without offence they might haue left vndone. Such was that of
<note n="d" place="margin">Pſ. 132. 3, 4, 5</note> DAVID, <hi>I will not goe vnto the Tent of mine Houſe, nor climbe vp my Bed-ſtead, nor ſuffer ſleepe in mine eyes, nor ſlumber in my eye-lids, till I find out a place for</hi> IE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>HOVAH, <hi>&amp;c. an habitation for the mightie God of</hi> IA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>COB.

               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, When we are ſlacke to performe them: <hi>When</hi> 
                  <note n="g" place="margin">Deut. 23. 21.</note> 
                  <hi>thou voweſt a <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ow to</hi> IEHOVAH <hi>thy God, thou ſhalt not delay to performe it: for</hi> IEHOVAH <hi>thy God will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly require it of thee, and it ſhall be ſinne vnto thee. When</hi>

                  <hi>as thou voweſt a <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ow to God, delay not to performe it: for God hath no pleaſure in Fooles.</hi> Yet for the performance of ſome greater dutie, our Vow may bee put off for a
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:29324:102"/> time, as the example of the Rechabites <note n="i" place="margin">Ier. 35. 7. 14.</note> doth confirme, of whom the Lord himſelfe beareth witneſſe, <hi>that they obſerued the vow of</hi> IONADAB <hi>their father, charging them not to dwell in houſes, but in Tents continually;</hi> though for ſafetie of their liues they came to dwell in Ieruſalem.</p>
               <p>For the performance of the duties of this Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement,<note place="margin">Whereunto are requiſite Preparation,</note> are required in all, but eſpecially in the publike ſeruice of God; Firſt, Preparation of our ſelues before wee come: by conſidering both the cauſe that ſhould mooue vs to it, and how to performe it with greateſt du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and reſpect; as the Preacher doth exhort vs: <hi>Take</hi>

Doe not confuſedly ſpeake with thy mouth, nor let thy heart make haſte to vtter a word before God: for God is in Heauen, &amp; thou art vpon the Earth: Therefore let thy words be few.</hi> To which purpoſe it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, that we vſe priuate Prayer before-hand, and take ſpeciall view and examination of our ſinnes, that hinder our approch to God.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Diligent attention. Being come, and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling<note place="margin">and Humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> at the preſence of God, before whom wee ſtand; like vnto that good woman
<note n="l" place="margin">Acts 16. 14.</note> LYDIA, <hi>whoſe heart God opened, that ſhee attended to the things ſpoken by</hi> PAVL. And as <hi>Cornelius</hi> did, <hi>Acts 10. 33.

               </p>
               <p>Whereupon, euerie where in the Scripture it is made a proper marke of Gods Children, to tremble at his Word: <hi>To</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, Meditation, and chewing as it were the cud, when we are departed; as the men of
<note n="n" place="margin">Acts 17. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>Berhea</hi> did; who, after they had heard PAVL, <hi>ſearched the Scriptures whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thoſe things were ſo.</hi>

               <pb n="167" facs="tcp:29324:102"/>
               <p>For the fitting of vs to ſome more ſpeciall parts of his<note place="margin">And when need is, both faſting, to quicken vs to petition in the acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our vnworthineſſe and wants, and feaſting to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe our thankfulneſſe for his bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits.</note> worſhip, are required both Faſting, and a holy Feaſt: Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting, to quicken vs to petition in the acknowledgement of our wants; holy Feaſting, to expreſſe our thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe for his benefits. This vſe of Faſting, the King of <hi>Nineueh</hi> was not ignorant of, when <hi>hee gaue</hi> 
                  <note n="o" place="margin">Ionah 3. 9, 10</note> 
                  <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement by the Decree of the King and his Nobles, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Let neither Men nor Beasts, nor Heards, nor Flockes taste any thing, nor feede, nor drinke water; but let Men and Beasts couer themſelues with Sack-cloth, and cry vnto God ſtrongly, &amp;c.

The contrary hereof, is that which the ſame Prophet repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hendeth in the people, <note n="q" place="margin">Eſay 22. 12.</note> 
                  <hi>In that day the Lord</hi> IEHO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VAH <hi>of Hoaſts called to weeping, and to mourning, to bald<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and to girting with ſackcloth, and behold, gladneſſe and ioy, killing of Oxen, and ſlaying of Sheepe, eating fleſh, and drinking Wine.

               <p>The exerciſe of Feaſting was taken vp amongſt Gods people, when they had receiued ſome ſingular benefit, or deliuerance from ſome notable euill, which by Faſting and Prayer they had begged at his hands. In which Feaſts, a more liberall vſe of the creature is permitted, both for plenty and variety, and all kind of honeſt iollity and pleaſure. <hi>Goe your wayes,</hi> it is ſaid, <hi>Nehem. 8. 11, 13. eat fat things, and drinke ſweet things, and ſend portions to him for whome nothing is prouided; for this day is holy to our Lord. So the people went to eate, and to drinke, and to ſend portions, &amp; to celebrate great gladneſſe.</hi> And in <hi>Heſter 9. 19. They celebrated the fourteenth day of the Moneth</hi> Adar,

But of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie one whole day in ſeuen, is thus to bee kept holy,</note> Church, we muſt doe it on ſuch dayes and times of the day, as may ſtand with the conueniencie of that Church.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, One whole day in ſeuen is of neceſſitie to be kept holy. This the Scripture calleth by excellencie the Sabbath Day, without a difference, as it were the elder brother to all the reſt of the dayes of the weeke, which is called <note n="t" place="margin">Leuit. 23. 15. &amp; 25. 8, 8.

                  <hi>Sabbaths</hi> in the plurall.</p>
               <p>The parts of the ſanctifying of this day are two: one, to reſt from worldly buſineſſes, and from thoſe workes and duties of our calling, which at other times are not onely lawfull, but expedient and neceſſarie to bee done. The particular workes that we are thus to abſtaine from, are of two kinds: Firſt, great aſwel as ſmal, and ſmal aſwel as great. A greater and more excellent worke can hardly be imagined, then the building of Gods owne Houſe, the materiall and outward Tabernacle, yet euen That the Lord by a ſtrict &amp; preciſe caution doth ſpecially for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid vpon this day, <hi>Exod. 31. 13. Yet, ſaith hee, yee ſhall obſerue my Sabbaths:</hi> Not ſetting your hand in that day vnto this worke, though it be moſt holy. Thoſe holy wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that had Odours, Oyntments, and all things in a readineſſe, yet in a religious obſeruation of Gods Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, forbare on the Sabbath to embalme the precious bodie of our Lord and Sauiour Chriſt, and are commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the Holy Ghoſt for it. <hi>They</hi>

               <p>In the ſecond place come things both neceſſarie and delightfull, of profit, and of pleaſure. <hi>In ſeed time and in harueſt</hi> the fitteſt ſeaſons for all worldly commodities,

                  <hi>thou ſhalt keepe Sabbath,</hi> ſaith the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Exodus</hi> 34. 21. Of this kinde are trauailing and iournying vpon that Day; whereof the Law is giuen, <hi>Exodus 16. 29. Tarrie euery man in his place: Let no man goe out of his place the ſeuenth Day.</hi> Likewiſe Faires, Markets, and all kinde of buying and ſelling: for which cauſe <note n="x" place="margin">Nehem. 13. 19 Reade Verſe, 15 16, 17, 18.</note> 
                  <hi>Nehemia</hi> that godly Magiſtrate, <hi>When the gates of Ieruſalem began to bee darke before the Sabbath, commanded to ſhut the gates, and charged that they ſhould not be opened till after the Sabbath, and ſet ſome of his ſeruants at the gates, that there ſhould be no burden brought in vpon the Sabbath Day.</hi> Sporting al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, banquetting, and ſuch like, which diſtract our minds from Gods Seruice, are then to be auoyded, which is that the Lord calleth, <hi>Not to do our owne delight vpon that Day, Eſay</hi> 58. 13. The doing of which things, or of any of them, is contrarie to this outward ſanctifying of the Sabbath.</p>
               <p>Yet can we not ſay, that all theſe things are vtterly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden without exception: certaine cautions muſt bee made:</p>
               <p>Firſt, Things of common honeſtie, and for neceſſarie ſafegard of that which would otherwiſe periſh, are law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full vpon that Day. Our Sauiour taketh that for granted, euen amongſt thoſe that moſt ſtraightly vrge the Letter of this Law, <hi>What</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Secondly, Such are allowed as take vs not away from the Seruice of God, but ſerue for honeſt and needfull re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation, to make vs fitter for holy things.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Hither belong thoſe labours and bodily workes which are done for the ſetting forth of Gods Glorie, as hee that being made whole, tooke vp his Bed<note place="margin">Both with publike and priuate ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes.</note> and carryed it on the Sabbath Day, <hi>Iohn</hi> 5. 8, 9.</p>
               <p>The next part of the ſanctifying of this Day, is, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy it in the Seruice of God, which is that whereunto
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:29324:104"/> the outward reſt tendeth, <hi>Eſay 58. 13.

               <p>Firſt, All religious and holy exerciſes, whereof theſe the Scripture noteth by name, as duties to be performed vpon that Day:</p>
               <p>Firſt, To heare the Word preached, <hi>Acts 13. 14. 15. After the reading of the Law and the Prophets in the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue</hi> on the Sabbath Day, <hi>the Ruler of the Synagogue ſent vnto them, ſaying, Yee men and Brethren, if yee haue any word of exhortation for the People, ſay on.

               <p>Thirdly, To receiue the Sacraments at the times ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed. <hi>Acts 20. 7. The firſt Day of the Weeke, when the Diſciples were gathered together to breake bread,</hi> PAVL <hi>preached vnto them, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, Collections and gathering for the Saints: 1. <hi>Cor. 16. 2. The firſt Day of the Weeke, let euery one lay aſide by him, treaſuring vp what hee hath beene proſpered.</hi>

               <p>Secondly, The duties of brotherly loue, as diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting<note place="margin">In which num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, the duties of brotherly loue, as diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting to the poore accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Gods bleſſing vpon vs, viſiting the ſicke, helping our Neighbor, or any thing that is his, in their diſtreſſe, come alſo to bee reckoned, when they are done as works of Mercie.</note> to the poore, according to the good hand and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of God vpon vs, viſiting the ſicke, helping our Neighbour, his Oxe, Aſſe, or any thing in diſtreſſe, when they are done, not for our owne lucre, but as workes of mercy and compaſſion. Thus did <note n="a" place="margin">Acts 20 9.</note> 
                  <hi>Paul</hi> vpon that day reſtore him, that being ouercome with ſleepe, while <hi>Paul</hi> was preaching, the night of the Sabbath Day, fell downe from the third Loft, and was taken vp dead, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 9. And hither tendeth the ſaying of our Sauiour Chriſt, <hi>Marke 2. 27. The Sabbath was made for man, and not man for the Sabbath.</hi> The contrarie hereof is the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward obſeruation, without reſpect of inward godlineſſe.</p>
               <p>The Seuenth Day thus to bee kept holy, was in the <note n="b" place="margin">
                     <hi>Gen. 2. 3. Exod.</hi> 20. 10, 11. This day, in the firſt inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution was the Seuenth Day from the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath Day.</note> firſt inſtitution the Seuenth Day from the Creation, when God reſting from his owne worke of creating the World, which in ſix dayes he had finiſhed, ſanctified that Day for a Day of reſt, and named it the Sabbath Day, beginning on the Euening of the day before, when <note n="c" place="margin">

               <p>And this Seuenth <hi>Day</hi> is all to be kept holy, from the beginning to the end, riſing vp early in the morning for the ſanctifying of it, after the example of our Sauiour Chriſt, <hi>Marke</hi> 1. 35. continuing it till the night; and in the night, as the
<note n="e" place="margin">Pſal. 92. 3.</note> Pſalme made for the Day ſpeaketh, that ſo our verie ſleepe may bee the ſweter to vs.</p>
               <p>The obſeruation of the Sabbath Day (which hath a ſpeciall Item giuen to it, <hi>Remember the Sabbath Day that thou keepe it holy</hi>) is a morall and a perpetuall Law, not onely Ceremoniall and for a time: for</p>
               <p>Firſt, It is the ſame which was <note n="f" place="margin">Gen. 2, 2, 3.</note> inſtituted in Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe,

               <p>Secondly, It is written by the finger of God, in the Tables of the Couenant, where there was nothing Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall, but all Morall, and of perpetuall indurance.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Our Sauiour, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 40. willing them that long time after his death ſhould bee aliue, to pray that their flight might not be on the Sabbath, ſheweth, that it was not to haue an end by that Sacrifice of his, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by <note n="g" place="margin">Dan 9 24.</note> all Ceremonies were aboliſhed.</p>

               <p>Eightly, To keepe ſilence in Courts and places of Iudgement, till we haue leaue to ſpeake: which modeſty is noted in PAVL, <hi>Acts 24. 10. who after that the Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour had beckened vnto him that he ſhould ſpeake</hi> (and not before) <hi>anſwerd, &amp;c.</hi>

               <p>Secondly, Fom Children to their Parents. <note n="u" place="margin">Epheſ. 6. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>Children, obey your parents in the Lord: for that is right.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, From Wiues to their Husbands. <note n="x" place="margin">Epheſ. 5. 22, 23. 4. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>Wiues, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit your ſelues vnto your Huſbands as vnto the Lord: for the Huſband is the Wiues head, euen as Chriſt is head of the Church, and the ſame is the Sauiour of his bodie.

               </p>

               </p>
               <p>Secondly, Shaking off the yoke of ſubiection to Princes, as the Papiſts doe.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The reſiſting of lawfull power, whereof the Apoſtle <note n="c" place="margin">Rom. 13. 2.</note> ſaith, <hi>Whoſoeuer reſisteth authoritie, reſiſteth the Ordinance of God: and they that reſiſt, ſhall receiue to themſelues iudgement.</hi> Contrary to the other, is diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, which is one of the ſinnes the Apoſtle reckoneth vp, <hi>Rom. 1. 30. diſobedient to Parents.</hi> But this obedience is not abſolute, without bounds or limits: It muſt bee<note place="margin">Or (when it cannot with a good conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence be done)</note> in the Lord: for that which the Apoſtle writeth vnto Children, <hi>Epheſ. 6. 1.

Therefore <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 3. 22. hee maketh the feare of God, the Rule of Seruants obedience: <hi>Seruants, obey your Maſters, &amp;c. fearing God.</hi> And the like is to be ſaid of Magiſtrates, as we are taught, <hi>Acts 4. 19. Whether it be right in the ſight of God, to obey you rather then God, iudge ye.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What muſt be done then, if they command things vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull, ſuch as with a good conſcience wee cannot yeeld vnto?</p>
               <p>Verily in ſuch caſes wee are patiently to abide the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment:<note place="margin">patiently to beare the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment.</note> In which doing, we no way violate the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience due vnto them. To this patient ſuffering of the puniſhment, the Apoſtle doth exhort vs, 1. <hi>Pet. 2. 19, 20. For this is thank-worthy, if a man for conſcience towards God endure griefe, ſuffering wrongfully: for what praiſe is it, if when ye be buffeted for your faults, you take it patiently? But if when ye doe well, ye ſuffer wrong, and take it patiently, this is acceptable to God.</hi> The contrarie whereof is,</p>
               <p>Firſt, Anſwering againe, when wee are reprooued,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:29324:108"/> which the Apoſtle condemneth, <hi>Let</hi>

                  <note n="e" place="margin">Gen. 16. 6.</note> did. The dutie we owe to Magiſtrates and Miniſters are,</p>

Chron. 16. 22. Whoſe ſeeking to the Phiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians in his diſeaſe,</hi> being good, onely his not ſeeking firſt to God, is condemned.</p>
               <p>The contrarie whereof is, giuing or our ſelues to ſin, whereby we pull euill and affliction vpon our ſelues: <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, thou art made whole, ſinne no more, lest a worſe thing come vnto thee. Ye</hi>

                  <hi>followeth her ſtraight-wayes, as an Oxe that goeth to the ſlaughter, and as a Foole to the Stockes for cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, till a Dart ſtrike thorow his Liuer, as a Bird haſteth to the ſnare, not knowing that he is in danger.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, The caſting of our ſelues into vnneceſſary dangers, whereunto the Deuill tempted Chriſt, <hi>Mat. 4. 6, 7. If thou be the Sonne of God, caſt thy ſelfe downe: for it is written, that he will giue his Angels charge euer thee, &amp; with their hand they ſhall lift thes vp, leſt at any time then

               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, Surfetting. <hi>If</hi>

                  <hi>thou haue found Hony, eate that is ſufficient for thee, lest thou bee ouer-full and vomit it vp.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, Eating out of time. <hi>Wo</hi> 
                  <note n="d" place="margin">Eccleſ. 10. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>to thee, O Land, when thy King is a Child, and thy Princes eate in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fiftly, Spending of our ſelues by vnchaſte behauiour: for that the Wiſeman giueth vs a watch-word, <hi>Pro. 5. 11. Lest thou mourne at thy latter end, when thou haſt conſumed thy fleſh and thy body.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, Giuing place to anothers fury, as <hi>Iacob</hi> did to <hi>Eſau,</hi> by his Mothers counſell, <hi>Gen. 2. 7, 44. Tarrie with my brother</hi> LABAN <hi>a while, vntill thy Brothers fierceneſſe be aſſwaged.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, By a iuſt defence of our ſelues when wee are aſſaulted, though it be with the hurt or killing of our Aduerſaries, where <note n="e" place="margin">Numb. 35. 22</note> otherwiſe we cannot eſcape, and we our ſelues haue no deſire or purpoſe of Reuenge, but<note place="margin">2. Sam. 14. 7. 10.</note> onely to ſaue our ſelues.</p>
               <p>The other Dutie that concerneth the bodie, is a come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Buriall of the dead, whereof wee haue a worthy Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, <hi>Acts 8. 2. Then certaine men fearing God, carryed forth</hi> STEPHEN <hi>among them to bee buried, and made a great lamentation for him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſpeciall vertues that lead vs by the hand to the<note place="margin">Where the ſpeciall ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues that leade vs by the hand to the keeping of this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, are Meekneſſe &amp; Kindneſſe. Meekneſſe in a gentle,</note> keeping of this Commandement, are two: Meekneſſe and Kindneſſe: Of Meekneſſe, we reade, <hi>Mat. 5. 5. Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed are the meeke in ſpirit.</hi> And for the ſame, <hi>Moſes</hi> is commended, <hi>Numb.</hi> 12. 13. that hee was an exceeding meeke man, <hi>aboue all the men vpon the face of the Earth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Meekneſſe is ſeene,</p>
               <p>Firſt, In gentleneſſe of nature, or a harmeleſſe minde. The contrary whereof is, the vſing of any of GODS
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:29324:115"/> Creatures hardly, euen the poore beaſt: <hi>A righteous man regardeth the life of his beaſt,</hi> ſaith SALOMON, <note n="f" place="margin">Pro. 20. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>but the mercies of the wicked or cruell.</hi> The Law <note n="g" place="margin">Deut. 22. 6.</note> of God that ſaith, <hi>If thou find a Birds Neſt in the way, in any Tree or on the ground, whether they be young or Egges, thou ſhalt not take the Damme with the young;</hi> was grounded vpon this equitie, to forbid a hard and vnmercifull heart.</p>
               <p>Secondly, In a peaceable diſpoſition, <hi>He</hi> 
                  <note n="h" place="margin">1. Pet. 3. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>that lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth</hi>
                  <note place="margin">and peaceable diſpoſition,</note> 
                  <hi>to ſee good dayes, &amp;c. let him ſeeke peace and follow after it. If</hi>

                  <hi>it bee poſſible, as much as lyeth in you, haue peace with all men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The contrary whereof is frowardneſſe or vneaſineſſe to be reconciled; one of the offences reckoned, <hi>Rom. 1. 38. Men that can neuer be appeaſed.</hi> Of this peaceable diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition there be three ſteps or degrees:</p>
               <p>Firſt, A readineſſe to depart from ones right: As <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi>
                  <note place="margin">ready to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from ones right,</note> 
                  <note n="k" place="margin">Gen. 13. 9.</note> was content to doe to LOT. <hi>If thou take the left hand, then will I goe to the right; and if thou goe to the right hand, then will I goe to the left. Mat.</hi> 17. 25, 26. Chriſt the Sonne of God giueth a notable preſident of this, who, though he were the Sonne, and therefore free, yet paid tribute, to auoyde offence. The <note n="l" place="margin">1. Cor. 6, 7.</note> Apoſtle to the Corinths ſharply taketh them vp for lacke of this vertue: <hi>Why doe you not rather take wrong? Why doe you not rather ſuffer loſſe?</hi> The contrary is, that which hee there
<note n="m" place="margin">1. Cor. 6. 8.</note> addeth, <hi>Nay, ye your ſelues doe wrong and do harme, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, When one is ſlow to wrath: <note n="n" place="margin">Pro. 19. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>The diſcretion</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Slow to wrath,</note> 
                  <hi>of a man deferreth his anger.</hi> The contrarie whereof is vnaduiſed Anger, condemned, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 22. This vnadui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Anger ſheweth it ſelfe two manner of wayes; Firſt, in haſtineſſe, when it is either without cauſe, or for ſmall cauſe, which <hi>Salomon</hi> oppoſeth to the former vertue, <hi>Pro. 14. 29. He that is ſlow to wrath, is of great wiſdome: but he that is of an haſtie minde, ſtirreth vp folly:</hi> for anger vpon iuſt cauſe is a good and holy thing, and was in our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Chriſt, <hi>Marke</hi> 3. 5. The <note n="o" place="margin">
                     <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 26.</note> Apoſtle alſo ſaith, <hi>Be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grie, but ſinne not.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="193" facs="tcp:29324:115"/>
               <p>Secondly, When our anger being vpon iuſt cauſe, yet we paſſe meaſure, as <note n="p" place="margin">1. Sam. 25. 13, 33.</note> 
                  <hi>Dauid</hi> did in the matter of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal,</hi> or dwell too long vpon it; whereof wee haue a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept,
<note n="q" place="margin">Epheſ. 4. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>That the Sunne goe not downe in our wrath.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The fruits of this kinde of peaceable diſpoſition are notable: Firſt, the preuenting of all occaſions whereby Anger may be kindled: and for this cauſe, it is lawfull to make couenants with Infidels and Heathens, ſo farre as they tend onely for preſeruation of peace; as
<note n="r" place="margin">Gen. 21. 23.</note> 
                  <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> and after him, <hi>Iſack</hi>
                  <note n="ſ" place="margin">Ge. 26. 28, 29.</note> made with <hi>Abimelech,</hi>
                  <note n="t" place="margin">Gen. 31. 52.</note> 
                  <hi>Iacob</hi> with <hi>Laban,</hi> and many other recorded in the Booke of God.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The appeaſing of it being kindled, whereof <hi>Abigal,</hi> in <hi>Dauids</hi> furie, giueth a worthy preſident, 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 25. 18. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>It is wrought,</p>
               <p>Firſt, By ouer-paſſing ſome wants and infirmities in mens words or deeds: As, <hi>It is the</hi> 
                  <note n="u" place="margin">Pro. 19. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>glorie of a man to paſſe by an offence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, By couering them with ſilence, and kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping ſecret the offence of our Neighbour, where Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian loue doth not compell vs to diſcloſe it: for <hi>Loue will</hi>
                  <note n="x" place="margin">1. Pet. 4. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>couer a multitude of ſinnes.</hi> And the Wiſeman tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth vs, <hi>He</hi> 
                  <note n="y" place="margin">Pro. 17. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>that couereth a tranſgreſſion, ſeeketh Loue: But he that repeateth a matter,</hi> (by rubbing vp the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of it, when it is gone and paſt) <hi>doth ſeparate a Prince:</hi> that is, maketh euen the greateſt friends to fall out. The contrary whereof are complaints one of another; as that of the Phariſes, <note n="z" place="margin">Marke 7. 3.</note> to our Sauiour Chriſt, againſt his Diſciples, for eating bread with vnwaſhen hands. This vice <note n="a" place="margin">Iude v. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>Iude</hi> noteth in his Epiſtle, <hi>Theſe are Complay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, By courteous anſweres in word or deed: <hi>A ſoft</hi> 
                  <note n="b" place="margin">Pro. 15. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>anſwere putteth away wrath, but grieuous words ſtirre vp anger.</hi> Take <hi>Gedeon</hi> for an <note n="c" place="margin">Iudg. 8. 1, 2, 3</note> Example, whoſe kinde ſpeech and vſage pacified the fierce wrath of the Ephrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites.
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:29324:116"/> As on the other ſide we reade, 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 19. 44. that the inſolent and proud anſwere of the men of Iudah, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed reuolt from the King, that followed in the next Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. The contraries are,</p>
               <p>Firſt, Bitterneſſe in ſpeech taxed, <hi>Rom. 3. 14. Whoſe mouth is full of curſing and bitterneſſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, Brawling and chiding, as that of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraimites, <hi>Iudg.</hi> 8. 1. Crying, which is an vnſeemely lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vp of the voyce, whereof we haue an Example, <hi>Acts</hi> 22. 23. As, <hi>They cryed and brake their Garments, and caſt duſt into the Ayre.</hi> And againe, <hi>Acts 23. 9. Then there was a great cry, and the Scribes on the Phariſes part conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe three the Apoſtle hath altogether, <hi>Epheſ. 4. 31. Let all bitterneſſe, and rage, and wrath, and crying, and euill ſpeaking be taken from you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, Lowring, or frowning, as <note n="d" place="margin">Gen. 4. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>Kain,</hi> who being <hi>exceeding wroth, his countenance fell downe.</hi> So <note n="e" place="margin">1. Sam. 18. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>Saul</hi> is ſaid to eye (or looke a-ſquint vpon <note n="f" place="margin">Pſal. 10. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid.</hi>)</p>
               <p>Fiftly, Snuffing: whereby <hi>Dauid</hi> painteth out a wicked man. <hi>He ſnuffeth,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>at all his Aduerſaries.</hi> And in another <note n="g" place="margin">Pſal. 12. 5.</note> place God is brought in, ſaying, <hi>For the deſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the needie ones, for the mourning of the poore ones, I will vp now, ſaith</hi> IEHOVAH, <hi>and ſet at ſafetie him whom the wicked man ſnuffeth at.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third ſtep of a peaceable diſpoſition is, ſuffering<note place="margin">and patient to indure wrongs</note> of wrongs patiently, leſt they breake forth into further miſchiefe. <hi>Take,</hi> ſaith IAMES, <note n="h" place="margin">Iames 5. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>for an example of ſuffering wrongs, and of long patience, the Prophets, &amp;c.</hi> The contrary whereof, are grudges growing from impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encie, though ſomething or other haply keepe it from breaking ſorth. <hi>Grudge</hi> 
                  <note n="i" place="margin">Iames 5. 9.</note>

               <p>Kindneſſe, the other vertue, ſtandeth in two things:<note place="margin">Kindneſſe, in a louing diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</note>

               <p>Firſt, In a kinde and brotherly affection from one vnto

               </p>
               <p>Of this nature, are firſt deriſion and ſcorning, as it is ſaid <note n="o" place="margin">Gen. 21. 9.</note> of the ſonne of <hi>Hagar</hi> the Egyptian, that hee mocked <hi>Iſack.

               </p>

               </p>
               <p>An Example thereof is extant, <hi>Mat. 12. 1. At that time</hi> IESVS <hi>went on a Sabbath Day through the Corne, and his Diſciples were an hungry, and began to plucke the Eares of Corne, and eate.</hi>

               <p>Thoſe degrees you haue all reckoned, <hi>Leuit.</hi> 18. and are theſe that follow:</p>

               <p>All which degrees are in like ſort, and by the ſame analogie and proportion forbidden to the Woman: and in the right line either aſcending or deſcending, the ſame prohibition reacheth in a manner infinitely.</p>

               <p>In the fourth place, I ſay, a man<note place="margin">The defenders of Polygamie.</note> and a woman, becauſe Marriage is betweene two, <hi>Euery</hi> 
                  <note n="a" place="margin">1. Cor. 7. 2.</note>

               </p>
               <p>Secondly, Hereby there commeth a ſeed of God, or a holy ſeed acceptable vnto him, in the reſtraint of all ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing luſts: for <note n="d" place="margin">Mal. 2. 15.</note> why made he one? <hi>Becauſe hee ſought a ſeed of God,</hi> ſaith the ſame Prophet.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The words of the Law rightly vnderſtood, are expreſſed, <note n="e" place="margin">Leuit. 18. 18.</note> 
                  <hi>Thou ſhalt not take one Wife to another to vexe her, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Laſtly, If a man may meaſure the childes goodneſſe, by the Fathers vertues, the firſt Polygamiſt and corrupter (this way) of Gods Ordinance, was <note n="f" place="margin">Gen. 4. 19.</note> 
                  <hi>Lamech,</hi> a vile wretch, of the poſterity of wicked <hi>Cain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fiftly, I ſay, <hi>Into one fleſh;</hi> For that by Marriage thoſe that were two before, are now become but one. So was the firſt inſtitution, <hi>Geneſis 2. 24. They ſhall bee one fleſh.</hi> And <hi>Matthew</hi> 19. 5. Our Sauiour according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concludeth, <hi>Wherefore they are no more two, but one fleſh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whereof it followeth, that Marriage is a perpetuall bond, ſo as <hi>Whoſoeuer</hi>
                  <note n="g" place="margin">Mat. 19. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>putteth away his Wife, except
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:29324:119"/> it be for fornication, and marryeth another, committeth adulterie: and he that marrieth her ſo put away, commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth adultery.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Howbeit, if one of the<note place="margin">The Popiſh Bygamy, which accounteth him to haue two Wiues that marryeth againe, after the firſt Marriage diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued, or hath marryed a Widdow.</note> parties dye, the other then is at libertie to marrie againe: <hi>For the</hi>

                  <hi>woman is bound by the Law as long as her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band liueth: but if her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band dye, ſhe is free to marrie whom ſhe will.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Laſtly, concerning Marriage, this one thing is to bee added, that it is conuenient that a ſolemne contract of the parties married ſhould goe before.</p>
               <p>By contract, I meane a promiſe of both the parties to marrie the one with the other, if in the meane time there appeare no iuſt cauſe to the contrarie: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it is eaſie to diſcerne, what is the right vſe and end of a contract, namely, that before that indiſſoluble knot doe come, the parties may thorowly acquaint themſelues together, that ſo any lawfull impediment to hinder their meeting, may in time be diſcouered, before it proceed further; and this is conuenient;</p>
               <p>Firſt, Becauſe it is warranted by the example of Gods Children <note n="i" place="margin">As may bee ſeene, <hi>Deut. 22. 23. Mat. 1. 10.</hi>
                  </note> in all times, and by the light of Nature a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the very Heathen.</p>
               <p>Secondly, God himſelfe approueth it, in prouiding for the chaſtitie of a woman ſo contracted, no otherwiſe then as if ſhee were his wedded Wife; that he <note n="k" place="margin">Deut. 22. 23, 24.</note> which lyeth with her, ſhall dye the death.</p>
               <p>The contraries of this puritie, which hitherto haue beene ſpoken of, are</p>
               <p>Firſt, Inward and in the minde, the luſts of <note n="l" place="margin">1. Cor. 7. 9. It is better to marry, then to burne.</note> concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcence, as the Apoſtle doth oppoſe them, 1. <hi>Theſſ. 4. 5. Let euery man know how to poſſeſſe his veſſell in holineſſe and honour, not in the luſts of concupiſcence, as the Gentiles that know not God:</hi> Which luſts of concupiſcence elſe-where
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:29324:120"/> he calleth burning, for that thereby godly motions <hi>as with fire are burnt vp</hi> and conſumed. Of theſe, Chriſt ſpeaketh, <hi>Mat. 5. 28. Whoſoeuer looketh vpon a woman, to luſt after her, hath alreadie committed adultery with her in his heart.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, All bodily pollution and vncleanneſſe, as the ſinne of <hi>Onan,</hi> for which the Lord ſlue him, <hi>Geneſis</hi> 38. 8. The like whereof is that, <hi>Deut.</hi> 23. 10, 11. when it commeth from immoderate dyet or vnchaſte thoughts.</p>
               <p>More particularly is condemned all vnlawfull copula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the ſeuerall kindes thereof; Buggerie, Adulterie, Fornication.</p>
               <p>Buggerie (a ſinne not to be named) is a copulation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt nature, whether with beaſts, diſhonouring our owne Sexe, or of men or women in the ſame Sexe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting filthineſſe: <hi>Thou</hi>

                  <hi>cauſe, God deliuered them vp into diſhonorable luſts; for euen the Females changed the naturall vſe, into that which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to nature: likewiſe alſo the Males, leauing the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall vſe of the Female, burned in their deſire one vnto ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Males with Males committing filthineſſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This was the ſinne of Sodome: <note n="p" place="margin">Gen. 19. 5.</note>

               <p>The other two are Adulterie and Fornication.</p>
               <p>Adulterie, when one or both are marrryed to another.</p>
               <p>Fornication, when two vnmarryed perſons commit it: Of both which, the Apoſtle ſaith,

Therefore the Apoſtle <note n="d" place="margin">1.

               <p>Temperance is a moderate and a ſober vſe of lawfull<note place="margin">Temperance, which is a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate and ſober vſe of lawfull Pleaſures, eſpecially in meates and drinkes,</note> pleaſures, eſpecially in Meates and Drinks, and in mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage matters.

               <p>This Commandement hath commonly another ſence of forbidding onely the firſt luſts and motions of ſinne, but the reaſons to confirme the Interpretation which I haue giuen, I take it (vnder reformation) are plaine and pregnant, which notwithſtanding I offer; without pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudice of other mens opinions, ſubmitting my ſelfe and them to thoſe that can better iudge.</p>
               <p>Firſt, The plaine euidence of the words: <hi>Thou ſhalt not couet thy Neighbours houſe:</hi> which is to be inforced by the conference of the reſt of the Commandements: <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour thy father and thy mother: Thou ſhalt not kill: Thou ſhalt not ſteale: thou ſhalt not commit adultery: thou ſhalt not

               <p>Thirdly, The particular inſtances, <hi>Thy Neighbours Houſe, Wife, Man ſeruant, Maide, Oxe, Aſſe, or any thing that is his,</hi> declare manifeſtly, that goods and poſſeſſions are the proper ſubiect of this Commandement: for which cauſe, <hi>Exodus</hi> 20. 17. the Wife of our Neighbour (his moſt <note n="y" place="margin">Pro. 19. 14.</note> precious poſſeſſion) commeth not in the firſt place, but is ſet in the middeſt of other poſſeſſions, that by the very marſhalling of the words, it might ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, that this Commandement reacheth not to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring of ones Wife for filthineſſe and vncleanneſſe ſake.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The order of the Commandements, going by degrees from the greater to the leſſe, and ſo conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually falling, till you come to this ſinne of couering, which is the firſt ſtep and beginning of all wrong and deceit, and yet differeth in nature from them both.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, Adde hereunto that which I hold as a certayne ground, and is prooued before at large, that the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion both of nature and deſire, is forbidden in euery one, ſo as this cannot be reſtrayned to a ſeuerall degree of ſin, but a differing and diſtinct kinde of ſinne from thoſe that went before.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, and laſtly, our Sauiour Chriſt, the beſt Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter

Now if a man ſhall aske but what good commeth to vs by the keeping of theſe Commandements? This, if there were no more, is aboundantly ſufficient, that God is thereby glorified.

<pb n="223" facs="tcp:29324:130"/> as if wee were to gaine Heauen by it. But ſee the exceeding bountie and goodneſſe of God, that will not haue vs ſerue him for nought. He is pleaſed for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect keeping of his Law, and the Righteouſneſſe by him inioyned, not onely to promiſe a recompence of reward, but to contract and couenant with vs, and vnder certaine conditions, as it were, to binde himſelfe vnto it, which is the ſame that we call the Law or Couenant of workes; the firſt Couenant that euer God made with his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. The ſumme whereof is in few words, <hi>He</hi> 
                  <note n="b" place="margin">Rom. 10. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>that doth theſe things, ſhall liue by them.</hi> As on the other ſide, <note n="c" place="margin">Gal. 3. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>Curſed is euery one that continueth not in all the things that are written in the Booke of the Law to doe them.</hi> For this Couenant requireth workes done by the ſtrength of Nature, and according to the Law of our Creation, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to Gods Iuſtice, the expreſſe Image whereof is in the Morall Law: And therefore the nature of Men and Angels, beautified in their firſt Creation with Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and the light of Gods Law written in their heart, is the ground and foundation of this Couenant: for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe it could not haue ſtood with the Iuſtice of God, to require theſe things at their hands, vnleſſe the Law of GOD had beene ſtamped and ſigned in them, and their nature made holy and pure, able by Creation to doe the ſame.</p>
               <p>The Couenant therefore of Workes, hath thoſe two parts before remembred: for the Law of God, as all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Lawes that are but ſtreames and ſhaddowes of that euerlaſting Law, is vpholden by two things, reward and puniſhment; without which, there would bee neither care to obſerue, nor feare to breake it.</p>
               <p>This reward commeth from Gods free and vndeſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued goodneſſe: for what can the Creature deſerue at the Creatours hands, doing nothing but that which the Law of his Creation bindeth him vnto? Wherefore our Sauiour, <hi>Luke</hi> 17. 10. doth admoniſh, when wee haue
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:29324:131"/> done <hi>all things that are inioyned vs, we muſt ſay, we are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable ſeruants: for we haue done nothing elſe but that we ought to doe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And therein lyeth a mayne difference betweene the reward and puniſhment: for the puniſhment is in Iuſtice, and ſinne hath indeed a merit belonging to it, the merit of Gods heauie wrath and indignation as it is ſaid, <note n="d" place="margin">Luke 12. 48.</note>

               <p>A good conſcience I call that, which beareth record to vs, that we doe well in all things, and therefore are to be rewarded; whereof our Sauiour ſpeaketh, <hi>Iohn 8. 29.

               <p>Againe, from the puniſhment it followeth, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwiſe, ſinne hath attending vpon it, guilt and an euill conſcience.</p>
               <p>Guilt is an eſtate, that, by reaſon of our ſinne, bindeth vs ouer vnto puniſhment, and maketh vs ſubiect to the wrath of God, as our Sauiour doth expreſſe it, <hi>Mat. 5. 22. He that ſaith to his Brother, Foole, is guiltie of Hell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fire, Geneſis</hi> 4. 7. It is compared to a Curre, or a Maſtiffe Dogge, which is alwayes arring and barking againſt vs: <hi>If thou ſinne, ſinne lyeth at the doore,</hi> readie to flye in thy face, and to take vengeance on thee. <note n="g" place="margin">Heb. 10. 22.</note> An euill, conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, (ſo called by the Apoſtle, from the effects) is that, which, by reaſon wee haue ſinned, telleth vs of the

               <p>For albeit they were created holy, yet being Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, conſequently they were of a changeable diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and therefore ſubiect to temptations, and to bee o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercome of them, if they were not vpholden by the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural grace of God, which neither in Iuſtice he nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, nor in his wiſdom &amp; goodnes ſaw it fit to do, diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of their fall for the better ſetting forth of his glory.</p>
               <p>The reaſon that actually they fell, was, For that they were left vnto themſelues: whereby it came to paſſe, that in their owne free will, and of their voluntarie choice, they leaned vnto euill: albeit by the integritie of their nature, they were able to haue kept themſelues vpright: As the Apoſtle <note n="r" place="margin">Iames 1. 13.</note> doth pronounce, <hi>that God tempteth no man, but euery one is tempted, being drawne away, and enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by his owne luſts.</hi> And <hi>Eccleſ. 7. 29. God made all men righteous, but they themſelues haue ſought many Inuentions,</hi> other then according to right.

<pb n="228" facs="tcp:29324:133"/> are knowne vnto him from all eternitie,</hi> but yet without ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of the ſinne.</p>
               <p>The time when they fell, was anon after the Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but how long after, the Scripture ſaith nothing: how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit, till the ſixt Day was paſſed, it ſeemeth they conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in their firſt integritie: <hi>For</hi>

                  <hi>then God ſaw all that hee had made, and it was exceeding good.</hi> Beſide, touching man, the Commandement for the Sabbath was giuen to him in Paradiſe after the ſixt Day. So the Story <note n="u" place="margin">Gen. 2. 2, 3.</note> telleth vs, <hi>When God had perfected his Worke that he had made, the ſeuenth Day he rested, and bleſſed the ſeuenth Day, and ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified it, becauſe in it he had reſted from all his worke.</hi> The fourth Commandement hath it a little playner: <hi>In ſixe dayes</hi> IEHOVAH <hi>made Heauen and Earth, the Sea and all that is in them, and reſted the ſeuenth Day: therefore</hi> IEHOVAH <hi>bleſſed the Sabbath Day and hallowed it:</hi> By his owne example enioyning on that Day, a perpetuall Reſt to vs: wherefore the three firſt Verſes of the ſecond Chapter of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> as it ſeemeth, ſhould not be deuided from the former Chapter, that contayne a Iournall of the firſt ſeuen dayes, which being finiſhed, <hi>Moſes</hi> taketh vp a new Prooeme to beginne a new narration. The fall now and puniſhment that came of it, is to be conſidered in each of theſe Creatures diſtinctly and apart.</p>
               <p>In the fall of Angels, theſe things are remarkable:</p>
               <p>Firſt, They were the firſt that fell: whereupon the<note place="margin">Firſt, of the Angels.</note> Deuill is called the firſt founder of ſinne, <hi>Iohn</hi> 8. 44.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Their ſpeciall ſinne what it was, appeareth not ſo euidently in the Scripture. IVDE ſaith, <hi>They left their owne habitation.</hi> And PETER, <hi>that they ſinned.</hi> Our SAVIOVR, that <hi>they continued not in the truth:</hi> meaning, the firſt integrity wherein God had ſet them, which is all the Scripture in expreſſe termes and proper deliuereth of their fall.

                  <hi>Leſt being puffed vp, hee fall into the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation of the Deuill:</hi> we may ſafely gather, that pride was either the ſinne it ſelfe, or mixed with it, in that, by their wiſdome and vnderſtanding diſcerning of a more excellent condition then their owne, they both in Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment approoued, and in will affected and deſired to haue the ſame: for thereunto afterwards they tempted man. Wherefore the fall of Angels was more grieuous then the fall of man, in as much as hauing a more excellent meaſure of holineſſe, they were more able to reſiſt, and fell without temptation, and therefore were the ſole in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of their owne fall; not that God had no ſtroke therein, (who moderating all things that come to paſſe<note place="margin">Some only fel, but a great multitude:</note> in the world, in ſo great an action as this, could not but haue ſome hand, diſpoſing of it to the manifeſtation of his owne glorie,) but becauſe they fell without any outward temptation, ſaue onely ſuch as their owne thoughts did<note place="margin">More then 12.

               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, That not all the Angells fell, but ſome cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine<note place="margin">Heb. 12. 23. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite thouſands.</note> ones onely: as may appeare by all the places of Scripture mentioning their fall.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The number of them which ſinned, which was exceeding great: for a whole Legion of deuils is mentioned, <note n="d" place="margin">Luk. 8. 30.</note> 
                  <hi>Luk.</hi> 8. 30. but the certaine number is no where expreſſed in the Scriptures, nor whether more did ſtand or fall; albeit the number of the holy Angels doe farre <note n="e" place="margin">Matt. 26. 53.</note> exceede the greateſt number of Deuils that is <note n="f" place="margin">Which is one Legion onely, <hi>Luk.</hi> 8. 30.

               <p>And to this end, is God pleaſed thus to releaſe them,<note place="margin">that ſo they may be inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to work his pleaſure here among vs</note> that ſo he may vſe them as inſtruments to work his good pleaſure here among vs: either for the comfort of his children, (though they labour all they can to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie,) or the plaguing of the wicked.</p>
               <p>This is their eſtate, till a ſet and ſolemne day appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted<note place="margin">All this, till a day appointed which wee call the latter Day, when they ſhal receiue their laſt doome of an euerlaſting and more dreadful dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, with execution ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly.</note> of God for bringing them vnto Iudgement, which wee call the latter Day, when they ſhall vndergoe the whole extremitie and fulneſſe of Gods wrath, in a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and more fearefull manner.</p>
               <p>That they are then to bee brought vnto iudgement, it appeareth out of that which <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iude</hi> doe ſpeake: Agreeable whereunto is that of PAVL, <hi>Do you not know, we ſhall iudge the Angels? 1.

               <p>So much may ſuffice for the Angels that fell.<note place="margin">The Angels that fell not, are ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally vpholden from all dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of falling.</note>

               <p>The Angels that ſinned not, are ſupernaturally vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpholden from all poſſibilitie of falling. Therefore our Sauiour, <hi>Marke</hi> 12. 25. compareth the ſtate of Gods Children in the Reſurrection, when all ſhall be firme and

               <p>But I ſay, This holding vp is <hi>ſupernaturall:</hi> they haue it not from their owne vertue or excellencie of nature, (for why then ſhould not the reſt haue had it?) but by the meere fauour and goodneſſe of God.

                  <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. whereunto they came by theſe degrees: firſt, they <note n="g" place="margin">Gen. 3. 6.</note> beheld it, then they they deſired the beautie of it, thirdly, they tooke, and laſtly, did eate of it. Neither was this the onely ſinne: it was accompanied with a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of other ſinnes, drawing them to this actuall and open diſobedience of the Commandement of GOD, whereby the fouleneſſe of their offence doth the more appeare: As firſt, Infidelitie in a doubting of the truth of God, and falſifying of his Word: for he had ſaid, <hi>What day ye eate thereof, ye ſhall certainly dye.</hi> EVE reciteth to the Serpent, <hi>Leſt peraduentre yee dye:</hi> ſpeaking doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, as of a thing not certaine.</p>

               <p>Other circumſtances there are further to increaſe their ſinne:</p>
               <p>Firſt, That it was againſt their knowledge and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, though Satan had in ſome ſort blinded the eyes of their vnderſtanding.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that hauing but one onely Commandement, and that ſo eaſie to keepe, as to abſtayne from one onely fruit in ſo great plentie and varietie of other, yet they brake it.</p>
               <p>The next thing to bee obſerued in their fall, are the Actors themſelues, or at leaſt, ſuch as had ſome part in his buſineſſe.</p>
               <p>Firſt, God may bee ſaid an Actor, or rather, Ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeer and Orderer of the act done, who for the manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting of his Iuſtice and Mercie, purpoſed from euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting, by leauing our firſt Parents to themſelues, and the vſe of their owne free-will, through his infinite Wiſdome, Power, and Prouidence, ſo to rule and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of their fall, that it ſhould tend both to his owne glorie, and to the good of his Elect.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Satan was the principall Actor, who hauing<note place="margin">By Satans temptation</note> lately before falne in: a deſperate hatred of God, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie of Mankinde, tempted them vnto it.

               <p>The fetches and deuices which he had to draw her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Nets, are worthy to be conſidered:</p>

Now he ſtickes not monſtrouſly, audaciouſly, impudently, and like himſelfe, to belye God vnto his face, appealing to him for the iuſtifying of a moſt foule and horrible ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der againſt his owne Maieſtie; hee ſcoffes <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eue</hi> with his Equiuocatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, that <hi>their eyes ſhould be opened, they ſhould be</hi> (for ſooth) <hi>as Gods, &amp;c.</hi> he maketh a ſophiſticall Interpretatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the name that God had giuen to the Tree of knowledge of good and euill. This ſinne, fearefull at the firſt, and aſhamed to ſhew the face, when it getteth ſtrength, and groweth vnto a height, it becommeth moſt inſolent and intolerable.</p>
               <p>A fourth thing in this temptation of Satan, is, that he vſed the woman as an inſtrument to ſeduce the man. The laſt Actors were <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eue</hi> themſelues, who through weakneſſe, but voluntarie, and of their owne free-will, gaue place to this temptation.</p>
               <p>The third thing I obſerue in the fall of man, is, That in <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eue</hi> all Mankind did fall, he being conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red not as one priuate man, but as the father of all men, and ſuſtayning the publike perſon of Mankinde. And therefore wee all haue part in his tranſgreſſion: As the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Rom. 5. 12. In whom all men ſinned:</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we are his Off-ſpring and Poſteritie, and were in his loynes when hee offended. According whereunto, <hi>Heb. 7. 9, 10.

                  <hi>Abraham,</hi> in whoſe loynes hee was when hee met <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſedeck,</hi> payd Tithes vnto him. Which makes <hi>Adams</hi> ſinne the greater, in that he murdered not himſelfe, but all that come from him. And this is the firſt ſinne of all Man-kinde, that <hi>Adams</hi> eating of the forbidden fruit, with all the ſinnes that did accompanie it, is our eating, and we guiltie of the ſame offences, which is a ſinne fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine and without vs.</p>
               <p>Thus farre of the fall of man.</p>

                  <hi>Sinne that is ſo well fitted, to gird vs in,</hi> as a curbe and a bridle, holding vs backe, that wee are not able to runne the courſe that is ſet before vs. Thereof it is, that all our actions are corrupted and naught. <hi>Rom. 3. 12. There is none that doth good, no not one. Rom. 7. 5. When wee were in the fleſh, ſinfull affections wrought in our members, to bring
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:29324:140"/> forth fruit to Death:</hi> which fruits hee ſetteth downe, <hi>Titus 3. 3. For euen wee alſo were fooliſh, diſobedient, ſeruing luſts and diuers kinde of pleaſures, leading our life in malicouſneſſe and enuie, hated and hating one another.</hi> And how can it otherwiſe bee choſen, but that all our fruits muſt needes bee vnſauourie and bad, when as the whole Tree and all the twigs and branches of it are rotten and naught?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, and laſtly, it is called totall, in reſpect of both the parts of Righteouſneſſe, Pietie, and Iuſtice, which with all the powers of our ſoule and bodie, both by nature, and in all our actions, wee doe nothing elſe but continually tranſgreſſe. Therefore PAVL, <hi>Rom</hi> 1. 18. pronounceth of all men, <hi>that the wrath of God is reuealed from Heauen vpon all impietie and iniuſtice of men, as thoſe that with-hold the truth</hi> (or thoſe ſmall ſparkes of light that God hath left them) <hi>in vnrighteouſneſſe,</hi> meaning, that by reaſon thereof they ruſh forth vnto all vnrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe. And <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 24. hee willeth our renewing to be in both theſe parts <hi>of Holineſſe and Iuſtice,</hi> as being cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt in both by nature.</p>
               <p>All men by nature are thus alike ſinfull, neither doth face more anſwere vnto face, then one mans corruption anſwereth to another: but the fruits of ſinne are in ſome more aboundant: for as he that is ſicke of the Dropſie, the more he drinkes, the more he may: ſo men, by long cuſtome of ſinning, come at the length to ſuch an habit, that they are not afraid to laſh forth openly, audaciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and impudently into all euill; caſting off all feare of God, and reuerence of man, as he ſhameth not to profeſſe of himſelfe in the <note n="i" place="margin">Luke 18. 4.</note> Goſpell, and ſo come to bee Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters and prodigious in all kinde of wickedneſſe. Of theſe the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, <hi>Epheſians 4. 19. Who caſting off all griefe, haue giuen themſelues to wantonneſſe, to worke all vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſſe, euen with greedineſſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So much for their ſinfulneſſe.</p>
               <p>Touching their miſerable and curſed eſtate: albeit<note place="margin">For the reſt.</note>
                  <pb n="244" facs="tcp:29324:141"/> the wrath of God be fully and wholy powred forth vpon<note place="margin">1. The wrath of God vpon them.</note> all that ſinne, yet is it not ſo preſently: for being in his wiſdome and goodneſſe pleaſed to make a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene Angels and Men offending, both for that their ſtate and caſe doth differ, and for the Elects ſake, whom he meant to take out of the Race of <hi>Adam,</hi> hee purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with himſelfe not to ouer-whelme them at once, with the waight of his Iuſtice, as hee would the Angels that did tranſgreſſe, but in his mercie to ſpare them for a time, that ſo a way might be made for his, to come vnto Repentance. This time is the whole courſe of their life<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wherein they beare not the full burden of their ſinne that preſſeth downe to Hell, but feele onely ſome light beginning of that heauy Iudgement which hereafter is to ſeize vpon them, if by turning vnto God, they doe not repent, and turne the ſame away. Therefore the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle <note n="k" place="margin">Act. 27. 26, 27</note> ſaith, that <hi>God hath made of one bloud all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde to dwell vpon the face of the Earth, determining the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities of times which hee hath fore-ſet, and the ſet bounds of their habitation, that they may ſeeke the Lord, if ſo be by groping after him, they may finde him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is the reaſon why the whole courſe of our life is tearmed <hi>that Day,</hi>
                  <note n="l" place="margin">Iohn 9. 4.</note> wherein we muſt doe good, before the night come, when none ſhall be able to worke: that <hi>time of</hi> 
                  <note n="m" place="margin">Gal. 6. 8, 10.</note> 
                  <hi>ſowing,</hi> either to the fleſh or Spirit; the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueſt whereof ſhall be death or eternall Life: for ſuch as the houre of death findeth vs, ſuch ſhall our doome be, and with
<note n="n" place="margin">Heb. 9. 27.</note> Death, the irreuocable ſentence commeth. None ſhall riſe againe to better the things he hath done in the dayes of his fleſh, whether they be good or euill. No Sacrifice any more for ſinne, no interceſſion for the dead, no Purgatory to make them cleane. But whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer by Chriſts purgation are not in this life waſhed from their ſinnes, ſhall after this life lye and rotte in their ſins foreuer.</p>
               <p>The ſumme is, that albeit God in his mercie, for the
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:29324:141"/> cauſe before remembred, doe thus forbeare all, yet euen during
<note n="o" place="margin">Iohn 3. 18.</note> this life, ſuch as haue no part in Chriſt, that is to ſay, all men in themſelues conſidered, are indeed and truly, though not fully, accurſed: for ſo the Scripture ſpeaketh, <hi>Hee that beleeueth not, is alreadie condemned.</hi> And
<note n="p" place="margin">Gen. 4. 11.</note> GOD telleth CAIN, <hi>Curſed art thou euen whileſt thou now art aliue.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In this eſtate I conſider three things:</p>
               <p>Firſt, The guilt of ſinne, whereof the <note n="q" place="margin">Rom. 3. 9.</note> Apoſtle wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſeth, that <hi>all the World is ſubiect to the iuſt puniſhment of God.</hi> And againe, <note n="r" place="margin">Heb. 2. 15.</note> that <hi>all men</hi> naturally and in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues conſidered out of Chriſt, <hi>are ſubiect vnto bondage.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, As before, whileſt they ſtood in their inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gritie, inioying the comfort of a good conſcience, they had peace and quietneſſe of minde: ſo man had no ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner falne, but feare and terrour came vpon him. As wee ſee in <hi>Adam, Gen. 3. 10. I heard thy voyce, and was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid.</hi> And as it may be ſeene in all the ſonnes of <hi>Adam,</hi> who in reſpect of ſinne, <note n="ſ" place="margin">Heb. 2. 15.</note> are in a perpetuall feare of death all their life long. Wherefore the <note n="t" place="margin">Rom. 8. 15.</note> Apoſtle no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth it the generall condition of all Mankinde, before they be renewed, to be poſſeſſed with <hi>the ſpirit of bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age vnto feare:</hi> The fruit whereof is, the drawing vs from God, and to make vs flye from him, as from our Enemie, as <hi>Adam</hi> 
                  <note n="u" place="margin">Gen. 3. 8.</note> fled from the preſence of God, and hid him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe among the Trees of the Garden.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The particularities of this curſed &amp; miſerable eſtate, which all the ſonnes of <hi>Adam</hi> doe welter and lye in all their life, are manifold, and of diuers kindes, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending <note n="x" place="margin">Deut. 28. 61, and 29. 20.</note> all the plagues and puniſhments that may be thought of, written &amp; not written: but the chiefe and principall of euery ſort, as they lye in order, oppoſite to the happie and bleſſed eſtate before deſcribed, are theſe that follow:</p>
               <p>Firſt, The wrath of God: for ſo the Holy Ghoſt ſaith, <note n="y" place="margin">Iohn 3. 36.</note> 
                  <hi>He that beleeueth not the Sonne, the wrath of God</hi> (now)
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:29324:142"/> 
                  <hi>abideth vpon him.</hi> But this is not the full cup of his wrath,<note place="margin">So farre, that all things, not bleſſings one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but his very graces turne to their ruine.</note> the dregges whereof the wicked ſhall drinke hereafter: for that no man can indure, and liue: but qualified and mixed, that it breaketh out, yet no further then this, to turne all things to their ruine, not onely outward bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, wherein God lifteth them vp, that hee may with a greater force caſt them downe; but euen the good gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of God, and gifts of his holy Spirit, which all, through their owne fault, worke vnto their euill, Chriſt is to them a Rocke

<note n="c" place="margin">2.

And this is contrarie to that loue, wherewith God before imbraced man:</p>
               <p>Secondly, Separation from the fellowſhip of God, as<note place="margin">2. Separation from his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence:</note> 
                  <hi>Adam</hi> was caſt out of Paradiſe, the viſible teſtimonie of his preſence. In regard whereof, the Apoſtle <note n="e" place="margin">Epheſ. 4. 18.</note> ſaith, <hi>We are eſtranged from the life of God, are</hi>

                  <hi>ſtrangers and forainers,</hi> and <note n="g" place="margin">Epheſ. 2. 17.</note> 
                  <hi>farre off</hi> from him.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Loſſe of our ſoueraigntie, and conſequently,<note place="margin">3. Loſſe of our former ſoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigntie, and conſequently, of our power, inſomuch as both the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,</note> of the power wee had to rule and to command: In ſo much as the Creatures that before were ſubiect to vs, ſhaking off the yoke of their obedience, are, through <hi>Adams</hi> fall, armed to our deſtruction: the wilde beaſts of the field readie to deuoure vs, and all the creatures to riſe vp againſt vs. Wherefore the <note n="h" place="margin">Iob 5. 22, 23.</note> Holy Ghoſt noteth it a fruit of our reconciliation vnto God, <hi>Not to bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of the beaſts of the Earth, but to bee in league with the ſtones of the field, and to haue the beaſts of the field in peace,</hi> as being otherwiſe at warre and at defiance with vs.</p>
               <p>More then that, a thing moſt oppoſite to our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer<note place="margin">and we Slaues to Satan.</note> ſoueraigntie and dominion, Satan himſelfe, the moſt

That part indeed of his image, which ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth in righteouſneſſe and true holineſſe, is quite and cleane aboliſhed, that not ſo much as any ſteps or frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments doe remayne; the <note n="z" place="margin">Epheſ. 2. 1.</note> Apoſtle bearing witneſſe, that <hi>we are borne dead in ſinne:</hi> but the Image of GOD ſtandeth alſo in the excellencie of man, aboue other Creatures; of which dignitie or excellencie, but not of holineſſe or Innocencie, ſome reliques wee carrie yet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout vs,</p>
               <p>And they are, firſt, in the minde or bodie alone, and
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:29324:144"/> by themſelues conſidered, then in the whole man: In the minde.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Common principles of good and euill, which<note place="margin">Common principles of good and euil, (ſparkes of that light of nature)</note> the <note n="a" place="margin">Rom. 1. 18.</note> Apoſtle calleth Truth, that is, <hi>ſome ſeed of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall Truth,</hi> both for knowledge of God, and of our duties to our brethren, as that there is one God, and that the ſame God is to bee ſerued; that hee rewardeth thoſe that keepe his Law, and puniſheth the tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors; that men muſt reuerence their Superiours, and not harme their Neighbours, nor doe iniurie one vnto ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And from this light that euerie one carryeth about him, and is borne and bred together with him, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth the Law of nature, that nature, which now wee haue ſince the fall of <hi>Adam:</hi> therefore, <hi>Iohn</hi> 1. 9. it is ſaid, that euery man comming into the World, is lightened therewithall.</p>
               <p>And this ſerueth notably for the collection and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering of his Church out of the wicked World: for if all common honeſtie, all ſeedes of comelineſſe and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue were vtterly extinguiſhed and put out, how could either the Church bee gathered at all, or preſerued, or kept when it is once gathered?</p>
               <p>Secondly, A conſcience when we doe amiſſe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of<note place="margin">&amp; ſome ſeedes of conſcience,</note> naturally ſome ſeedes are left in euerie one, the better to repreſſe the vnbrideled courſe of our affections, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer ſome ſtruggle to ſhake them off, <hi>Rom. 2. 15. their conſcience accuſing or excuſing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now, this light of Nature and ſeedes of conſcience<note place="margin">which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding are wholy ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,</note> left in man, are good and holy things in themſelues, and of their owne nature, but in vs vtterly corrupt and naught: All whoſe parts and powers are wholy tainted and defiled with ſinne; that truly the <note n="a" place="margin">Titus 1. 15.</note> Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Both our minde and conſcience is defiled:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore they ſerue not at all to iuſtifie vs, as though<note place="margin">and doe but ſerue partly to keepe men from breaking forth, without all ſhame or regard of honeſtie, partly to make them vnexcuſable.</note> by our owne Wiſedome, Reaſon, Will, Deſire, or Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:29324:144"/> wee were able to doe or to indeuour that that is good, but partly to keepe men from breaking out, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſhame, vnto an ouer-bold and audacious defiance of all godlineſſe and honeſtie, partly to make vs inexcuſable in the ſight of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 20. For firſt, thoſe ſeedes of Truth and Light, which wee haue of God, are ſo farre from being our guide to leade vs vnto Heauen, the ſame being the proper office of Chriſt, <hi>Who</hi> 
                  <note n="b" place="margin">Ioh. 14. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>is the Way, the Truth, and the Life,</hi> as contrariwiſe they conuince vs e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery mothers childe, both of impietie to God, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſtice to men; in that wee ſhew not forth the power thereof in our liues, but reſtrayne and keepe it backe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſtly, to doe quite the contrarie: Inſomuch as men na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally <hi>knowing</hi> 
                  <note n="c" place="margin">Rom. 1. 19, 20</note> 
                  <hi>God, both his eternall Power and God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, yet they glorifie him not as God, but wax vaine in their reaſonings and diſputes,</hi> and ruſh forth into all vnrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe againſt men, as the Apoſtle there at large decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth. And the like may bee ſaid of the conſcience alſo, that it tendeth onely vnto this, to take away all excuſe from vs, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 15. So as our Deſire, Will, Affections, retayne now no part of our former conſcience, but are wholy brutiſh, ſenſuall, and ſlaues vnto ſinne, as wee heard before: Not that hereby wee take away all free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of will from man, but we teach, that the ſame hath place onely in the naturall inclinations common to all liuing Creatures, which naturally ſeeke their own good, life, nouriſhment, maintenance, preſeruation, propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, &amp;c. or in the outward actions of this life for mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of manners, gouernment of Houſes, Families, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, Cities, &amp;c. but not to doe the things that are good and pleaſing vnto God.</p>
               <p>The reliques of our former dignitie that yet remaine<note place="margin">In the bodie a kind of maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie:</note> in the bodie, are <note n="c" place="margin">

               <pb n="252" facs="tcp:29324:145"/>
               <p>In the whole <note n="d" place="margin">Gen. 9. 2.</note> man there is a certaine ſoueraigntie, that keepeth in awe the brute Creatures, inſomuch as<note place="margin">In the whole man, a certain ſoueraigntie, that keepeth in awe the brute crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.

               <p>Laſtly, the puniſhment of mans tranſgreſſion reſteth not in man alone, it is of a more large extent, &amp; reacheth, for mans ſake, to the other creatures: for as they were for his ſeruice and command made in all excellencie of perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: So by the fall of <hi>Adam</hi> he hath not onely vndone himſelfe and his poſteritie, but euen the brute beaſts and all the dumbe creatures are impayted by it, &amp; grone vnder that impayre: for ſo God pronounceth, <hi>Gen. 3. 17.

               <p>This which you haue heard, is that miſerable and wretched eſtate which ſinne hath drawne vpon all the ſonnes of <hi>Adam,</hi> ſo long as they liue in this World. That which we call full curſedneſſe, is a ſorer and a more grieuous puniſhment, the full cup of Gods heauie indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, inſupportable of all his Creatures: No Angell, no man, not all the Angels or men of the World able to

               <p>Two circumſtances there are, whereby theſe torments inſupportable in themſelues, are made yet more grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous.</p>
               <p>Firſt, By the place, Hell, where they are kept faſt bound in chaines and fetters of darkneſſe. In regard whereof it is called <hi>Outer</hi>

<pb n="254" facs="tcp:29324:146"/> not ſo grieuous, if it haue no intermiſſion, nor hope of any eaſe, is worſe then a thouſand deaths. O how much more then doth this exceede, which with the firſt waight thereof breaking the very bones, and all the veines and ſinnewes of their heart, muſt needes in the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlaſting continuance of it infinitely be increaſed.</p>
               <p>The ſinfulneſſe annexed to this eſtate, is hatred of God, finall deſperation and the full height and top of all iniquitie, as in the damned ſpirits we ſaw before.</p>
               <p>Further, to this eſtate three things are proper:<note place="margin">In ſoule pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently, till the latter Day.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, it lighteth vpon men, one by one, preſently af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter death. So hath the wiſdome of God ordayned, that when the courſe of this life is runne out, Iudgement ſhould then beginne vpon the ſoules both of the Elect and Reprobate, preſently departing into their place of ioy or of torment: a third place there is not any. So ſaith <hi>Peter</hi> 
                  <note n="t" place="margin">1. Pet. 3. 19.</note> of the wicked, diſobedient in the time of NOAH: <hi>That their ſpirits are in Priſon,</hi> chayned with the fetters of darkneſſe. And the Rich man, as ſoone as he dyed, was caſt into Hell: for (<hi>being in Hell</hi>) ſaith our <note n="u" place="margin">Luke 16. 23.</note> Sauiour Chriſt, <hi>in torments, he ſaw</hi> ABRAHAM <hi>a farre off, and</hi> LAZARVS <hi>in his boſome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For men, in this moſt excellent part of theirs periſh not like bruit beaſts, as the Sadduces of old, and now-a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayes the Libertines doe teach: neither<note place="margin">Sadduces and Libertines.</note> doth their ſoule vaniſh in the Ayre, or dye with the bodie, till the time of the reſtoring of all things, which is contrarie to the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of that ſpirituall nature, but it ſtill liueth and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nueth either in paine or comfort, <hi>Mat. 10. 28. Bee not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of them that kill the bodie, but are not able to kill the ſoule.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, Their ſoule onely feeleth this heauie tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, their bodies reſting in the graue, till the time of the diſſolution of all things.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The condition that men alſo muſt vndergoe
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:29324:146"/> in the end, is the whole extremitie and fulneſſe of Gods wrath to ſeize then vpon them, many degrees heauier then the puniſhment they felt before: that Iudgement going before the great and ſolemne Day, wherein all fleſh is to bee preſented before the Iudge of all the World, as it were a pettie Seſſions before the grand Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſes. Wherefore the Apoſtle calleth the laſt Day, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the wicked, <note n="x" place="margin">Rom. 2. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>A Day of wrath,</hi> becauſe then God will tread out the full Wine-preſſe of his wrath: and <note n="y" place="margin">2. Pet. 2. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>Peter</hi> by excellencie, <hi>A Day of Iudgement,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the wicked are reſerued to be puniſhed. And againe,
<note n="z" place="margin">2. Pet. 3. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>A Day of Iudgement and deſtruction of vngodly men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For to this purpoſe will God rayſe vp their bodies in the latter Day, that ſo their bodie and ſoule which haue both ſinned together, may be both together puniſhed: whereof they ſhall then receiue their ſentence and laſt doome, with execution accordingly. But of theſe two Doctrines, the Reſurrection and the laſt Iudgement, wee ſhall haue iuſt cauſe to ſpeake more fully and at large hereafter.</p>
               <p>A miſerable change to ſuch men as then are liuing,<note place="margin">A miſerable change to ſuch men as then are liuing. ſhall bee in ſtead of a death, and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from it.

               <p>The creature alſo, to make the curſe of man the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, is then ſubiect to an vtter abolition, hauing in the meane time their being and continuance for the Elects ſake, as the

               <p>By reaſon of the vnion of theſe natures into one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, theſe two things follow:</p>

               <p>Secondly, that hee might vndergoe the puniſhment due to ſinne, which the God-head, free from all ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, could not: And therefore alſo it was neceſſarie hee ſhould haue a ſoule, and not his God-head ſtand in ſtead of a ſoule: for our ſoules muſt haue periſhed euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtingly, except his ſoule had ſuffered for them.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, That he might be a fit Interceſſor for vs, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing taſted of our miſeries. All this the Apoſtle tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. from the tenth Verſe, to the end of the Chapter, ſetting forth moſt notably the rich and plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full comfort that we reape from hence, by many goodly Arguments.

               </p>
               <p>Againe, it was neceſſarie he ſhould be God:</p>
               <p>Firſt, Becauſe none but God could reueale vnto vs the will and pleaſure of God: <hi>For none hath aſcended into Heauen, but the Sonne of man that deſcended from Heauen, and is in Heauen, Iohn</hi> 3. 13. that is to ſay, No man euer did, nor by nature can attayne to the true knowledge of heauenly things, but hee that is alſo God, to wit, the Sonne, the eternall Wiſdome of the Father, as <hi>Iohn</hi> alſo ſaith, <hi>No</hi> 
                  <note n="n" place="margin">Iohn 1. 18</note> 
                  <hi>man hath ſeene God at any time, the onely begotten Sonne of God, which is in the boſome of the Father,</hi> that is, of one nature and eſſence with him, <hi>hee hath reuealed him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Neither had hee beene able to ſuſtayne the infinite wrath of God due to our ſinnes, much leſſe to ouercome it, if himſelfe had beene but a finite nature.</p>
               <p>Yea, meete it was hee ſhould be the Sonne of GOD: for being ſo by nature, hee is able to beſtow this priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge on thoſe that beleeue, to bee the ſonnes of GOD by adoption, <hi>Iohn</hi> 1. 12.</p>
               <p>The Vnion of both natures into one perſon was alſo neceſſarie.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That in him God and Man, wee might ſee and
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:29324:153"/> behold the Father: for ſeeing God in his owne eſſence and nature is inuiſible, and no conceit can poſſibly bee framed of him: the Apoſtle ſheweth, that for the ſtaying of our faith, and that our minde and vnderſtanding might haue ſomewhat to reſt vpon, we haue Chriſt <note n="o" place="margin">Col. 1. 15.</note>

               <p>Secondly, That thereby the obedience of Chriſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in the Man-hood, might be of infinite merit, as being the obedience of God himſelfe, 2. <hi>Cor. 5. 12. Him that knew not ſinne, he made to be ſinne for vs, that we might be made the righteouſneſſe of God in him.</hi>
               </p>

There is one Mediator betweene God and men, the Man Christ Ieſus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In this Office of Mediation, three things may bee conſidered.</p>
               <p>Firſt, The perſons both of the Mediatour and of thoſe for whom Mediation is made.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The point and propertie of the office of Mediation.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The meanes to effect it.</p>
               <pb n="279" facs="tcp:29324:153"/>
               <p>The Mediator is Chriſt, the Sonne of God, whom his Father in his infinite Wiſdome, Goodneſſe and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, prouiding a meanes, when there was no other meanes left in Heauen or vpon the Earth to ſaue vs, ſent downe his owne Sonne in the likeneſſe of ſinfull fleſh, to ſaue all Beleeuers: whereupon it is not onely ſaid, that Chriſt died, but that he was <note n="r" place="margin">Rom. 4. 25. &amp; 8. 32.</note> deliuered vp to death for vs: the exceeding meaſure of whoſe Mercie and Loue in this behalfe, is commended in the Scripture by two circumſtances; one is, the giuing of his Sonne, his onely Sonne, his beloued Sonne, for our Redemption. <note n="ſ" place="margin">1. Iohn 4. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>In this,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>was the loue of God manifeſted towards vs, that he hath ſent his only begotten Sonne into the World, that we ſhould liue by him.</hi> And our Sauiour Chriſt in
<note n="t" place="margin">Iohn 3. 16.</note> IOHN, <hi>God ſo loued the World, that hee gaue his onely begotten Sonne, that whoſoeuer beleeueth in him, ſhould not periſh, but haue euerlaſting life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond, is the time of this giuing of his Sonne for vs, euen then, when we were his enemies. This the ſame Apoſtle ioyneth with the former: <note n="u" place="margin">Iohn 4. 20.</note> 
                  <hi>Herein is loue, not that we loued God, but that he loued vs, and ſent his Sonne a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiation for our ſinnes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But moſt notably doth <hi>Paul</hi> vnto the <hi>Romanes</hi> inlarge this circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtance:

                  <hi>For Chriſt, when yet we were of no ſtrength, in his time dyed for the vngodly. Verily for a righteous man one would ſcarce dye: peraduenture for a man that hath beene beneficiall and good vnto him, ſome man would indure to dye. But God commmendeth his loue to vs that when we were yet Sinners, Chriſt dyed for vs: for if being enemies wee were reconciled to God through the death of his Sonne, how much more being reconciled, ſhall we be ſaued?</hi> Wherefore<note place="margin">Called of his Father,</note> he thruſt not himſelfe into this Office of Mediation, but had the warrant of a lawfull calling for it: for <note n="y" place="margin">Iohn. 6. 27.</note> 
                  <hi>him</hi> (as hee ſpeaketh of himſelfe) <hi>hath God the Father ſealed.</hi> And the Apoſtle to the <hi>Hebrewes,</hi>

And <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> though hee knew him not aright, acknowledgeth that <hi>he was a Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher come from God, Iohn</hi> 3. for how elſe might any man preſume to ſet his hand vnto ſo great a worke?

<note n="a" place="margin">Ier. 30. 31.</note> 
                  <hi>His Noble one ſhall be of him: And I will make him to approch, that he may come neere vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me: for who is hee that can promiſe in his heart to draw neere vnto me, ſaith</hi> IEHOVA? that is, (as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh to the <hi>Hebrewes</hi>) <note n="b" place="margin">Heb. 5. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>Who can take this honor to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,</hi> but Chriſt, who is called of God, and made our King and Prieſt?</p>
               <p>It ſtandeth (as euery other lawfull calling doth) on two parts:</p>
               <p>Firſt, Gifts, and Graces neceſſarie for the diſcharge of his Office, which God neuer ſeuereth from his cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings.</p>
               <p>Secondly, A ſolemne inueſting of him vnto his place. Both which concurre in Chriſt, <hi>Eſay 61. The Spirit of the Lord</hi> IEHOVA <hi>is vpon me: therefore</hi> IEHOVA <hi>hath anoynted mee, to preach vnto the poore: he hath ſent me, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Of his Graces the Pſalmiſt ſaith, <note n="c" place="margin">Pſal. 45. 8. Heb. 1. 9.</note>

                  <hi>boſome of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> how can hee bee without any Grace requiſite for him that ſhould be a Mediator?</p>
               <p>And neceſſary it was hee ſhould thus bee called and appointed, that wee might bee out of doubt of GODS acceptance of that which Chriſt hath done for vs, being his owne ordinance and appointment, and of his good pleaſure to ſaue vs through him: whereupon the Apoſtle

                  <hi>an offering</hi> and ſacrifice <hi>of a ſweet ſmelling ſauour to God:</hi> without which, all his ſufferings had bene in vaine.</p>
               <p>But albeit his Office of Mediation in Gods appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment were before all eternitie, yet actually it beganne<note place="margin">euer ſince the fall of <hi>Adam,</hi>

               <p>In regard partly of his calling to the Office of Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, partly, of the Graces that God his Father did adorne him with, hee is named Chriſt, that is to ſay, Anoynted: and becauſe alſo of Gods euerlaſting Decree, it is ſaid, <hi>Prouerbs 8. 23.

And this election of ſome, neceſſarily implyeth the reiecting of other ſome. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore here the whole doctrine of Gods holy Predeſtinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is ſummarily comprehended: A matter aboue all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, moſt religiouſly and ſoberly to be dealt in: not ſo much for any hardneſſe that is in it (which if wee keepe within the bounds and limits of the Word, is eaſie e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough

This will bee yet more eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, if we call to minde the manifold vſe of this Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, being the Roote of all Pietie, and the Baſe of all our comfort, then the which, none more highly exalteth the glorie of God in his Mercie and Iuſtice, nor throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth downe the pride of man more lowe, as in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe (Chriſt aſſiſting) more fully ſhall appeare.</p>
               <p>Wherein, for a better light of that which followeth, it is neceſſarie I ſhould firſt define Predeſtination. Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtination is one principall branch of Gods purpoſe, or eternall Decree concerning the finall eſtate of the moſt excellent creatures, Angels and men: The parts where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of are, Election and Reprobation: Election, which is of ſome certaine ones vnto Saluation: of men, but few, in reſpect of thoſe that are to periſh. Reprobation, which is of ſome certaine ones vnto damnation. The waight and degree of both, aſwell of glorie as of ſhame, to ſome in a leſſe, to ſome in a greater meaſure.</p>
               <p>To explaine this a little better, God, who onely is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall, the Father, Sonne and holy Spirit, purpoſing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all times the glorifying of himſelfe, as is moſt meet, and the declaration of thoſe wonderfull things that are in him, which by no other way then this could be made knowne, appointed firſt, beſide the ſetting forth of his power, patience, hatred of ſinne, loue of righteouſneſſe, and other vertues, to manifeſt the riches of his Mercie in certaine both Angels and men, knowne vnto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe who ſhould be ſaued; and in like ſort, the greatneſſe of his Iuſtice in certaine, both Angels and men to bee
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:29324:157"/> condemned: wherein, in looking to nothing elſe either preſent or to come, within vs or without vs, in Heauen or in Earth, but to himſelfe alone, hee choſe vs of his free good-wil and pleaſure. After which (for men them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, the All-wiſe God much more, aduiſe of nothing but they ſet the end before them, and firſt the end, then the meanes concurring to it.) After this therefore, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the cauſes, not in courſe of time (all his purpoſes being from eternitie, and none before or after other) hee purpoſed to create them both holy and righteous, like vnto himſelfe, who hauing free-will to imbrace either good or euill, and a nature ſubiect to temptation, ſhould of their owne accord voluntarily fall away, thereby ſubiecting themſelues to his wrath and indignation.</p>
               <p>Firſt, of the Angels, thoſe onely appointed to deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, whom hee neuer would repayre. The reſt hee did decree to eſtabliſh by his Grace, that they might not loſe their ſtanding, but abide faſt for euer in that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegritie which at the firſt he gaue them.</p>
               <p>Touching Mankinde, who were wholy to fall in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> for thoſe whom he did ſelect and ſeparate to bee ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by his Mercie, he purpoſed in the loue he bare them, not to ſpare his owne onely Sonne, the Sonne of his Loue moſt deare vnto him, but to ſend him into the World, to take vpon him our fleſh: In whom adopting vs for his ſonnes, being by faith in graffed into him, and made one together with him, hee would in his good time beſtow freely, through Grace, Wiſedome, Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, Sanctification, and Redemption. The reſt hee did decree to leaue in their ſinnes, and deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uedly to harden: and ſo their deſtruction to come from themſelues; the others Saluation from him and from his Mercie.</p>

               <p>Againe, if you looke to the end of Gods counſels, in the damnation of the wicked, the Apoſtle ſaith, it is not abſolutely and ſimply their deſtruction; as if God were like an vnmercifull and a cruell hard-hearted Tyrant, that taketh pleaſure in other mens ruines: but it is (as he ſetteth out in the example of PHARAOH) <hi>to ſhew forth his power, and to haue his Name publiſhed in all the Earth,</hi> making his Glorie to ſhine in their deſerued pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, whileſt thereby hee doth declare himſelfe an Enemie, and Reuenger of ſinne, Mightie in the executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Iudgements, Wonderfull in the riches of his Mercie towards the Elect; as one contrarie doth ſet forth another.</p>

                  <hi>Paul</hi> cry out, <hi>Who ſhall ſeparate vs from the loue of Chriſt?</hi> And our <note n="f" place="margin">Luke 12. 31.</note> Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our biddeth <hi>his little Flock</hi> (the whole Church and euery member of it) <hi>not to feare; becauſe</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>it hath plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed your Father to giue vnto you a Kingdome.</hi> And

               <p>This is to vs the foundation of all our comfort, that our Election being grounded vpon this brazen Hill of Gods eternall loue, can neuer be ſhaken, but remayneth faſt for euer. If it ſtood in our ſelues to bee the cauſe of our owne, either Saluation or Damnation, we ſhould all vndoubtedly periſh. Now that it wholly and alone re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth in God, who is moſt mightie to bring his counſels to paſſe, notwithſtanding all reſiſtances; wee haue a matter of firme comfort, that in vaine doth Satan labour, in vaine doth the World rage, and our owne corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons riſe vp againſt vs: for he to whom wee are giuen to keepe, is ſtronger then all, who will keep vs to that Day. For this cauſe, Chriſt is not content to ſay,
<note n="h" place="margin">Iohn 15. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>I haue cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen you:</hi> but addeth alſo, <hi>You haue not choſen me:</hi> ſhewing that herein indeed our comfort ſtandeth, that GOD, whoſe Counſels are vnchangeable, hath firſt elected vs.</p>
               <p>Againſt this Doctrine, in vaine doe men obiect that which is ſaid concerning the Booke of Life, out of which <note n="i" place="margin">Exod. 32. 32.</note> 
                  <hi>Moſes</hi> deſireth to be blotted out; and <note n="k" place="margin">Rom. 9. 30.</note> 
                  <hi>Paul</hi> to be an accurſed: and Chriſt promiſeth, <note n="l" place="margin">Reuel. 3. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>I will not blot out his Name out of the Booke of Life:</hi> for the ſpeech of our Sauiour Chriſt tendeth not to ſhew, that any, whoſe name is once genealoged in this Booke, may bee blotted out; but it is a phraſe taken from the manner of men, as where Repentance, Anger, and ſuch like are attributed vnto God. As for the example of <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Moſes,</hi> wee are not to eſteeme that holy affection peculiar vnto them, though they had it in a more abundant meaſure, but a common dutie of all Chriſtians to bee followed, to whom the Glorie of God ought to bee dearer then the Saluation of their ſoules: They therefore in a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:29324:163"/> ſo nighly concerning the Glorie of God, and the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of many ſoules, as it were forgetting, and rapt beyond themſelues, wiſhed to bee accurſed and blotted out of the Booke of Life; or which is all one; to bee Caſt-awayes, and damned Creatures, to ſaue (as they thought) the glorie of God. Not but that they knew the ſame was impoſſible; but carryed with zeale, they did as it were forget it. So Chriſt prayed that the Cup might paſſe from him; yet he knew full well it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible. And this vehemencie of ſpirit oftentimes ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth not onely in ſpeeches which are ſudden, but in writing, which is more deliberate. Although conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, as I ſaid, this ought to bee the ſtayed affection of vs all, that if it were poſſible, Gods Glorie could bee put in ballance with the loſſe of our ſoules, their ſauing muſt bee thought but light, that he may haue prayſe.</p>
               <p>Now, if any man ſhall thinke this to bee a Doctrine to Gods Children, of Securitie; becauſe howſoeuer they liue, it is impoſſible they ſhould periſh; and to the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked of deſpayre; becauſe whatſoeuer they doe, they can neuer come to bee ſaued, whereby all good indeuours ſhould be in vaine; hee miſtaketh the matter; the caſe is farre another: For no Doctrine more then this awake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth mans ſecuritie, none more amazeth the diſſolute and careleſſe liuer, ſince Faith and Sanctification bee or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayned for thoſe that are themſelues ordayned vnto Glorie, and none can bee aſſured hee is elect, but hee that is aſſured hee walkes in faith and newneſſe of life.</p>
               <p>Contrariwiſe, this Doctrine ſerueth not to throw a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man into deſpayre: for none is ſo wicked nor ſinneth ſo grieuouſly, to whom God offereth not Grace, if with an vnfayned heart he ſeeke it. And if thou ſay it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to ſeeke, where the Lord hath once reiected: yet thou muſt remember that Gods counſels are knowne vnto himſelfe, and he hath not communicated the ſecre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of Reprobation ſo plentifully, as hee hath of his
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:29324:163"/> Election; conſidering that there is no certaine note of Reprobation, either to a mans ſelfe or others, ſaue one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly That one ſinne againſt the Holy Ghoſt, which layeth hold but vpon a few. And the reaſon is plaine and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt: for he that to day is obſtinate and froward, an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie to God and to all goodneſſe, tomorrow may bee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered: and ſo long as this life continueth, ſo long there is a ſpace left for Repentance: many are called at the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leuenth houre, at the winding and ſhutting vp of the day, in the laſt act of their life. And ſo was the <note n="m" place="margin">Luk. 23. 40.</note> Thiefe vpon the Croſſe. And our <note n="n" place="margin">Math. 21. 31.</note> Sauiour telleth vs, that <hi>Publicans and Harlots,</hi> vile and deſpiſed perſons, often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times enter into the Kingdome of Heauen, before many that carrie a fairer ſhew: Thou oughteſt therefore, vſing the meanes, and ſetting ſtill at the feete of Chriſt, to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme God faithfull, that when hee offereth thee grace, he meaneth it for thy good; and that howſoeuer now thou feele no working of it, yet the moments of time are in his hands, who calleth how and when he will, and ſtill to haue comfort, and neuer to deſpayre.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, as Predeſtination is eyther to Life or Death:<note place="margin">and giuen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him,</note> ſo it is to thoſe ſubordinate things, whereby God hath purpoſed to bring his determinate Counſell to paſſe, both in the Elect and Reprobate.</p>

               </p>
               <p>The Obiections againſt all this that hitherto hath bin ſaid, are of no value. God (ſay ſome) would haue all men ſaued, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 4. and none <hi>to periſh, but all to come to Repentance, 2. Pet.</hi> 3. 9. And Chriſt is a Propitiation for the ſinnes of the whole World, 1. <hi>Iohn</hi> 2. 2. But they vnderſtand not that thoſe generall ſpeeches are to bee reſtrayned to the ſubiect there in hand: for the Apoſtle ſheweth in the firſt of thoſe places, that howſoeuer that be true, which elſe-where hee teacheth, that not many noble, not many mightie ones, not many of account are called to the profeſſion of the Goſpell: yet there is no eſtate ſo high, or great, nor any eſtate or ſort of men at all, but God hath his among them; for whom wee are to pray, that in his good time hee would vouchſafe to bring them to the knowledge of the Truth. And ſo is this particle <hi>all</hi> in ſundry places applyed to euery ſort and kinde, and namely, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4. 23. where our Sauiour Chriſt is ſaid to haue healed all diſeaſes, that is, all kind of diſeaſes. That of <hi>Peter</hi> is plainly meant of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect alone. And <hi>Iohn</hi> ſheweth, that our Sauiour dyed, not for the Nation of the Iewes, or thoſe that liued in his time onely, but for all the Elect of Iewes and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles out of euery Kindred, Tongue, Nation and People, as it is ſaid, <hi>Reuel.</hi> 5. 9. and of all ages from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the World. And ſo is this place notably ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, <hi>Iohn</hi> 11. 51, 52. that <hi>Ieſus was to dye for that Nation, and not for that Nation onely, but that hee might gather into one the Children of God diſperſed.</hi> According whereunto you muſt take the name of World, <hi>Iohn 1. 29. The Lambe of God, that taketh away the ſinne of the World.</hi> And <hi>Iohn 4. 42. This is of a truth that Chriſt
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:29324:166"/> the Sauiour of the World;</hi> and in other ſuch like pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
               <p>As for that dotage, that Chriſt ſhould dye for all, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely and without reſtriction, it is abſurd: for Chriſt died not for them for whom he vouchſafeth not to pray, nor is a Redeemer, where hee is no Interceſſor. Now he himſelfe ſaith, <hi>he</hi>
                  <note n="i" place="margin">Iohn 17. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>prayeth not,</hi> he is no Interceſſor for all. Therefore we may conclude, hee dyed not, hee is no Redeemer of all. Nay, the very diſtinction ſo common in the Schooles, betweene the ſufficiencie of Chriſts death, and the efficiencie of it; as though his death, or one drop of his bloud (as ſome are not afraid to ſpeake) were ſufficient for the ſaluation of all, though it effect not, nor worke ſaluation vnto all; is too light and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth no waight with it, if it bee waighed at the Lords Beame: for the ſufficiencie of Chriſts death is not to be meaſured by our owne conceit of it, but by the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and Decree of GOD. The <hi>Meſſias</hi> was neuer promiſed but onely to the Church: Therefore hee was neuer deſtinated but vnto them alone. To <note n="k" place="margin">Gen. 3. 15.</note> the reſt the ſeed or children of the Deuill, as hee calleth them, <hi>Iohn</hi> 8. 44. he is the Seed of the woman, to bruiſe and tread downe their head in perpetuall enmitie and defiance with them, not a friend to dye and ſuffer for them, being that wherein he doth ſo much <note n="l" place="margin">Rom. 5. 8.</note> commend his loue. Chriſt, indeed, gaue an infinite merit to all his Actions, to the end whereunto he purpoſed them, and ſuffered in waight and meaſure a proportionable puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the Redemption of all Gods people. But the Scripture ſpeaketh euidently, that <note n="m" place="margin">Gal. 2. 21.</note> 
                  <hi>Chriſt dyed not,</hi> he ſuffered nothing <hi>in vaine,</hi> nor more then was of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, for the ſauing of his Church. And when Prayers and Interceſſion which hee offered not for all, are one part of his Prieſthood, and conſequently of that ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciencie which it was requiſite hee ſhould performe to God-ward for vs, it is manifeſt that in the Ordinance
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:29324:167"/> and Decree of God, his death, without the ſame, had not beene <hi>thorowly</hi> ſufficient for the ſauing of the Elect themſelues, much leſſe of all the World. And why ſhould we imagine a halfe ſufficiencie wrought for them in his death and ſufferings, when the other part of his Prayers and Interceſſion, without which there is no complete nor perfect ſufficiency at all, cannot be drawne vnto them?</p>
               <p>No better is the Dreame of vniuerſall Grace in Chriſt, offered vnto all, and that for the vnbeliefe which God fore-ſaw would be in ſome, hee hath decreed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect them, which beſide the Word of God, common ſenſe and experience doth controll; ſince it is plaine, and ſtands prooued before at large, that all men are not cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, no, not without an outward call.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, The end of all is the ſetting forth of his Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie:<note place="margin">to ſet forth in them the prayſe of his Mercie.</note> ſpecially in Election, to ſhew the riches of his Mercie; in Reprobation, the ſeueritie of his Iuſtice, as the Wiſeman ſaith,

               <p>Firſt, That the Man-hood or humane Nature, by the wonderfull worke of the Holy Ghoſt, was ſanctified in the Virgins wombe, from all kind of ſinfulneſſe, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with an habit of moſt perfect Sanctimonie and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, in the verie firſt minute and moment of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception. In which regard, the <note n="t" place="margin">Luke 1. 35.</note> Angell vnto <hi>Marie</hi> calleth him, <hi>That holy thing that ſhall be borne of thee, &amp;c.</hi> wherein he differeth from all the ſonnes of <hi>Adam,</hi> as well as he doth in the manner of his conception.</p>
               <pb n="313" facs="tcp:29324:170"/>
               <p>Secondly, It was made a fit inſtrument for the whole<note place="margin">for the worke of the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> worke of the Mediation, that is to ſay, not onely for his owne performance of the Prieſtly Offices, but both for our incorporating into himſelfe, and for the quicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and giuing of Life, and Righteouſneſſe, and all good things to thoſe that are incorporate, and that by the power of his God-head ſanctifying the Man-hood, as hee ſaith, <hi>Iohn 17. 19. For their ſake doe I ſanctifie my ſelfe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is not therefore the God-head onely that quicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth vs, but the humanitie alſo, as an inſtrument or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duit whereby he doth it. And this is that our Sauiour ſaith, <hi>Iohn 5. 26. As the Father hath life in himſelfe.</hi> As if he ſhould haue ſaid, With God indeed is the fountaine of Life, and Grace, and all good things: but that which is locked vp and buried in his vnacceſſible Light, hee hath powred vpon the Sonne manifeſted in the fleſh, that from him, as from the Head, it might flow to euerie member of the Church; yea, hither driueth the whole tenour of his diſputation, <hi>Iohn</hi> 6. 53, 57, 63. concerning the true cauſe of our eternall Happineſſe.

<pb n="314" facs="tcp:29324:171" rendition="simple:additions"/> bloud, ye haue no life in you:</hi> he diſtinguiſheth two things moſt manifeſtly; Firſt, that his humane Nature, whether you conſider the eſſence of his Soule or Bodie, or any created vertue, or qualitie inherent, hath not of it ſelfe any quickening vertue in it, which is onely proper to his God-head, (then that the ſame is neuertheleſſe not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable, but a moſt neceſſarie inſtrument, which being firſt it ſelfe quickened by the God-head, whereunto it is perſonally knit) doth from the God-head powre life in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to as many as by faith are vnited to him, without whoſe fleſh the Spirit neuer quickeneth, no more then the ſoule maketh a man to vnderſtand, but by the braine. Therefore is the Man-hood aptly compared to a Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, which ſendeth forth moſt ſweet and comfortable ſtreames of water of life vnto all his members, and the Deitie to the Well-head, or to a Spring that miniſtreth continually vnto this Fountaine.</p>

                  <hi>God, my God, why haſt thou</hi> (all this while) <hi>forſaken me?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, The Apoſtle expreſly ſaith, that <note n="x" place="margin">Gal. 3. 13.</note> Chriſt <hi>was made a curſe for vs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And it cannot be, that hee meaneth that curſe, but of a ſhamefull and ignominious death only: for he ſpeaketh of the <hi>curſe due to euery one that continueth not in all things that are written in the Booke of the Law to doe them:</hi> from which, Chriſt redeemed vs, himſelfe being made that curſe for vs. Neither doth the reaſon which the Apoſtle rendreth, <hi>As it is written, Curſed is euery one that hangeth vpon the Tree,</hi> prooue that our Sauiour Chriſt was no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe accurſed, then as euery other Male factor is, or as the Thiefe vpon the Croſſe, whoſe ſoule notwithſtanding went to Paradiſe: but his reaſon ſerueth for the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, to prooue that this kinde of death was by way of Type and Ceremonie accurſed in the Law, prefiguring the curſe that was to light vpon our Sauiour Chriſt, in whom all the Ceremonies of the Law had their accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment and perfection.</p>
               <p>But how (will you ſay) could this feare in Chriſt be without ſinne? Becauſe it grew not from weakneſſe of faith, much leſſe from deſperation: for euen when hee cryed out in the anguiſh of his ſoule, <hi>Why haſt thou for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken me?</hi> yet he ceaſeth not to call him his God, of whom he complayneth himſelfe to bee forſaken; but it grew out of a meere humiliation: for howſoeuer, as touching his Diuine Nature, he were equall with GOD the Father, yet he found in his humanitie, wherein hee was to pay our ranſome; an exceeding vnabilitie to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie Gods Iuſtice, vnleſſe hee might bee pleaſed fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:29324:175"/> to accept the Sacrifice of his Bodie, not as the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of a man, but as the Sacrifice of his onely begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Sonne; and what was wanting in the weakneſſe of his humane Nature, to account ſufficiently made vp in the worthineſſe of his God-head. Beſides, he feared not an vtter deſertion or forſaking, which to feare were deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration, but leſt his humane Nature ſhould for a time be left alone without any comfortable aſſiſtance of the God-head, fearing in that diſtreſſefull agonie of his, and the verie confuſion of the powers of his nature, how long it might hold him, and how infinitely more it might increaſe vpon him, ſeeing that hee was not yet come to the greateſt of his Paſſion, from whence by a meere naturall deſire abhorring paine, which may well be without ſinne, he would haue gladly beene releaſed: And therefore praying it might paſſe from him, yet pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently ſubmitteth himſelfe vnto it, <hi>Mat. 26. 39. O my Father, if it be poſſible, let this Cup paſſe from me: Neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe, not as I will, but as thou wilt.</hi> And againe, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>erſe 42. O my Father, if this Cup cannot paſſe away from mee, but that I muſt drinke of it, thy will bee done.</hi> 
                  <note n="y" place="margin">Mar. 14. 36.</note> MARKE hath it thus: <hi>Father, all things are poſſible to thee; take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way this Cup from mee: Neuertheleſſe not as I will, but as thou wilt,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third thing to bee obſerued in his ſufferings, is,<note place="margin">All which hee fully ſatisfied,</note> that by the power of his God-head hee did indure and went thorow with them, and did not take the foile: for as a huge ſtone falling vpon a piece of britle glaſſe, grindeth it all to powder: but if it light vpon a thing as huge as it ſelfe, it is not able for to wagge it: ſo the infinite power of his God-head, ſtrengthened the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature of Chriſt to indure the brunt of the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite wrath and diſpleaſure of his Father in ſuch ſort, as it did not ouer-whelme him, but that in the middeſt of all his ſufferings, hee did in a manner conquer and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, laying in his humilitie the beginning (as it were)
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:29324:175"/> and foundation of his Glorie, and of his Kingdome, in his lowe eſtate.</p>
               <p>Whereof it followeth:</p>
               <p>Firſt, that in the middeſt of his moſt bitter ſufferings, he was freed from hatred of God, finall deſperation, and ſuch like, which are not of the ſubſtance of the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but lamentable and fearefull effects in thoſe that are ouercome of it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That hee was not, nor could not bee cruſhed with the waight of it, into Hell, the place of the damned.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, That making ſatisfaction, he did not lye for euer vnder it.</p>
               <p>But how then did hee pay the ranſome of our ſinnes <hi>which is Hell fire, the ſecond Death, euerlasting condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,</hi> if he neither were in Hell to ſuffer there, and came ſo quickly out of his ſuffering here?</p>
               <p>Theſe things, as hath beene ſhewed, are no part of the puniſhment, but effects, and things annexed to it, when the puniſhment it ſelfe is not able to bee indured, and hath no place where that is borne and ſatisfied. And yet it is more, that Chriſt the onely begotten Sonne of God, yea, God himſelfe, ſhould for a ſmall while thus beare the Curſe of the Law, then if the whole World had ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered eternall puniſhment in Hell fire.</p>
               <p>The fourth thing is, how and which way he ſatisfied<note place="margin">our curſednes here, in the whole courſe of his life.</note> all this, and when.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Our curſedneſſe here, he ſatisfied in the whole courſe of his life, as
<note n="z" place="margin">Mat. 8. 16, 17</note> the Euangeliſt out of the Prophet noteth, <hi>He healed all that were ſicke, that it might be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled which was ſpoken by Eſay the Prophet, ſaying, Hee tooke our infirmities, and bare our ſickneſſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, the infinite wrath of God his Father, hee<note place="margin">our full cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſſe, vpon the Croſſe,</note> ſatisfied vpon the Croſſe; for thither doth the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture euer call vs, <note n="a" place="margin">1. Pet 2. 24.</note> 
                  <hi>Who bare our ſInnes vpon the Wood, that</hi> 
                  <note n="b" place="margin">Epheſ. 2. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>hee might reconcile both in one bodie vnto GOD,
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:29324:176"/> through the Croſſe, killing enmitie through it;</hi>
                  <note n="c" place="margin">Coloſſ. 2. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>blotting out the hand-writing of ordinances that was againſt vs, which was ſecretly contrarie to vs, hee tooke it away, nayling it to the Croſſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, Death in the graue, where beeing ſolemne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly<note place="margin">and death, by dying: vnder the power whereof he lay three daies in the graue.</note> buried, to aſſure vs, his death was a true death, and not counterfeit, nor fayned, he lay three dayes vnder the ignominious dominion of it.</p>
               <p>The fift and laſt thing is the end, which is alſo the vſe and fruit of his ſufferings: Forgiueneſſe of ſins, Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification or Aboliſhing of our ſinful luſts, and the Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of vs from death and condemnation, as ſhall appeare hereafter.</p>
               <p>To come vnto the laſt of thoſe foure heads: our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiours<note place="margin">The glories of Chriſt that followed his ſuffrings</note> humbling of himſelfe, ſo farre, as to be obedient vnto death, the death of the Croſſe, it pleaſed God to crowne with an infinite waight of bliſſe, as the Apoſtle teacheth, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 9. Agreeable whereunto is that of the Prophet <note n="d" place="margin">Eſay 53. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>Eſay, Seeing he giueth himſelfe an Oblation for ſinne, hee ſhall ſee a ſeede, and prolong his dayes.</hi> And <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uel.</hi> 5. 12, 13. It is the voyce of infinite thouſands of holy Angels applauded by all the creatures in heauen, and vpon the earth, and by the foure liuing creatures and the foure and twentie Elders, <hi>Worthie is the Lambe that was ſlaine, to receiue power, and riches, and wiſdome, and ſtrength, and honor, and glorie, and praiſe.</hi> In which two, <note n="e" place="margin">1. Pet. 1. 11. Pſal. 22.</note> 
                  <hi>the ſufferings of Christ, &amp; the glories that did follow,</hi> the whole ſubſtance of the Goſpell ſtandeth, as he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe teacheth his Diſciples, <hi>Luk. 24. 26. Muſt not Chriſt haue ſuffered theſe things, and ſo enter into his glorie?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But had he no glorie at all, before he had finiſhed his ſufferings? Indeed during the time of his humiliation, which was all his life long, whileſt he bare the infirmity of our natures, and the puniſhment due to the ſame, the great happineſſe belonging to him, was ſmothered in ſome ſort, that it did not ſo appeare, neyther was the
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:29324:176"/> time for the full manifeſting thereof yet come: How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit, euen then he did not obſcurely make ouerture of it many wayes: For firſt, in that weakeneſſe of his fleſh, he gaue ſo liuely tokens of his glorie, that the <note n="f" place="margin">1. Tim. 3. 16.</note> Apoſtle feareth not to ſay euen then, <hi>When he was manifeſted in the fleſh, he was iuſtified in the Spirit.</hi> And <note n="g" place="margin">Acts 2. 22.</note> PETER calleth him a man <hi>approued of God, by the excellent Deedes, and miracles, and ſignes which God had done by him.</hi> Which, as <note n="h" place="margin">Iohn 2. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>Iohn</hi> noteth, were <hi>to manifeſt his glorie.</hi> In regard whereof he ſaith, <note n="i" place="margin">Iohn 1. 14</note> 
                  <hi>Wee ſaw his glorie, as the glorie of the onely begotten Sonne of God.</hi> But yet ſometimes more gloriouſly then at other, he was pleaſed in an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary manner to reueale it, as in his Transfiguring vpon the Mount, when <note n="k" place="margin">Matth. 17. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>his face ſhined as the Sunne, and his garments were made white as the light:</hi> In his <note n="l" place="margin">Iohn 2. 15.</note> whipping of the Buyers and Sellers out of the Temple: In his <note n="m" place="margin">Iohn 18. 6.</note> cauſing of them that came to apprehend him, onely by the power of his Word, to fall vnto the ground, &amp;c. yea, in the very midſt of all his ſufferings, and euen vpon the Croſſe it ſelfe, how did his glorie ſhine? taking vpon him to <note n="n" place="margin">Luk. 23. 42, 43.</note> diſpoſe of Paradiſe, the kingdome of heauen, at his pleaſure, and making heauen and earth, the liuing, and the dead, to worke together for the celebrating of his greatneſſe. When the Sunne aſhamed of their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
<note n="o" place="margin">Matth. 27. 45</note> pulled in his beames, and refuſed to giue them Light; when at <note n="p" place="margin">Matth. 27. 50, 51, 52.</note> his voice and the noyſe of his roring, the Earth trembled and ſhooke, the Vale of the Temple rent a ſunder from the top vnto the bottome; Rockes flew in pieces, the Graues were opened, and the Bodies of many dead Saints did ariſe; when hee wrung out of the <note n="q" place="margin">Matth 27. 54</note> Centurions mouth a confeſſion of his perſon, and made the <note n="r" place="margin">Iohn 19. 19, 20, 21, 22.</note> hands of <hi>Pilate</hi> imbrued with his bloud, to be the inſtruments of the publiſhing of his Office, and to lift vp the Standard of his prayſe to all people, Latines, Greekes, and Hebrewes, that not without iuſt cauſe, doth the <note n="ſ" place="margin">Coloſſ 2. 15.</note> Apoſtle ſay, that <hi>He ſpoyled Principalities and
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:29324:177"/> Powers, and led them in open ſhew, triumphing vpon the Croſſe.</hi> So as the ſhamefull and ignominious Croſſe was, contrary to its nature, ſo altered and changed by Chriſts Diuine Power, that it ſerued now for a Trophee, and Monument of his Victorie, being as a Chariot, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he rode more glorious, then any Emperour or Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate of the World, in the middeſt of his greateſt Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph, and had all the enemies of our Saluation, Satan, Sinne, Hell, and Condemnation led after him, chayned and faſt bound with all their weapons pulled from them, as men taken captiues.</p>
               <p>But this Glorie of his afterwards ſhined foorth moſt<note place="margin">were in ſoule or bodie apart, or ioyntly in them both: In ſoule, he went to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen preſently after death.</note> cleerely in foure ſteps or degrees.</p>
               <p>In the firſt place may bee reckoned (though it were not conſpicuous to the World) that he went in ſoule vnto Heauen after death. So hee <note n="t" place="margin">Luke 23. 43.</note> ſaith to the Thiefe, <hi>This day thou ſhalt bee with mee in Paradiſe.</hi> And after, being readie to giue vp the ghoſt, <note n="u" place="margin">Verſe 46.</note> 
                  <hi>Father, into thy hands I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit my Spirit.</hi> Which to bee meant of his preſent going to God his Father, is manifeſt by other places, where the like phraſe is vſed, as <hi>Acts</hi> 7. 59. in the Prayer of STEPHEN, <hi>Lord, receiue my ſpirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond ſtep is his Reſurrection, when in the<note place="margin">His bodie hee rayſed from the dead,</note> Chambers of death he conquered death it ſelfe, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Morſell that the graue was not able for to ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, aroſe from the dead, and made thereby a perfect conqueſt of all his foes, and full demonſtration of his Glorie, as the Apoſtle ſaith,
<note n="x" place="margin">Rom. 1. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>He was mightily declared to be the Sonne of God, as touching the ſpirit of Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by riſing from the dead.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In his Reſurrection I note theſe ſixe things:</p>
               <p>Firſt, The cauſe of his Reſurrection, which was by his owne Diuine Power.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The manner of his riſing mightily and powerfully, not bound hand and foote as <hi>Lazarus</hi> came forth; but like <hi>Samſon,</hi> hee <note n="y" place="margin">Acts 2. 24.</note> brake the bands of death and of the graue in ſunder.</p>
               <pb n="327" facs="tcp:29324:177"/>
               <p>Thirdly, What bodie hee roſe withall; a Bodie freed<note place="margin">glorious,</note> from all infirmitie, hunger, thirſt, wearineſſe, &amp;c. and indued with immortalitie, ſtrength, nimbleneſſe, agili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,<note place="margin">Behold my hands and my feet.

               <p>The third ſtep is, his moſt bleſſed and glorious Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſion: whereby, in ſtead of the lower part of the<note place="margin">In his whole perſon, ſoule and bodie, he aſcends into Heauen,</note> Earth, whither for his great loue vnto vs, he did willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly come downe, God hath taken him vp, and ſet him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue the higheſt Heauens, as the Apoſtle noteth, <hi>Epheſ. 4. 10, 11. Now this that he aſcended, what is it, but that hee firſt deſcended into the lower parts of the Earth? He that deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended, is the ſelfe-ſame that aſcended farre aboue all the Heauens, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Of this is the Storie recorded, <hi>Marke 16. 19. Luke</hi> 24. 51. and more fully, <hi>Acts</hi> 1. 29. that <hi>whileſt they looked, he was lifted vp:</hi> or, as the Angell calleth it, <hi>Acts 1. 11. ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken vp from them into Heauen,</hi> that is, his humane nature, by the power and vertue of his God-head, was truly and locally tranſlated from the Earth, into the higheſt Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens of the Bleſſed, where it is to remayne in all glorie and excellencie, till the latter Day, as the Angell telleth his Apoſtles, <hi>Acts 1. 11.

<pb n="328" facs="tcp:29324:178"/> Heauen muſt contayne, till the times of the reſtoring of all things.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For where our Sauiour ſaith, <hi>Mat. 28. 20. I am with you alwayes to the end of the World:</hi> and a <note n="c" place="margin">Mat. 26. 11.</note> little before had ſaid, <hi>Me you ſhall not haue alwayes among you;</hi> it appeareth, that the manner of his preſence is to bee di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed: for hee is preſent indeed alwayes with his Church, but by the power and comfort of his Spirit, whereby he doth communicate himſelfe, and all he hath, vnto vs, not in any corporall or bodily preſence.</p>
               <p>The time that hee thus aſcended both in Soule and<note place="margin">the fortieth day after his Reſurrection.</note> Bodie, was fortie <note n="d" place="margin">Acts 1. 3.</note> dayes after his Reſurrection, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring all which time hee was conuerſant with his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, teaching and inſtructing them aſwell in all points of Chriſtian doctrine, as in thoſe that belong to the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie and Gouernment of his Church: whereupon the <note n="e" place="margin">Heb. 3. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.</note> Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>He was faithfull in all the Houſe of God,</hi> after a more excellent ſort then <hi>Moſes</hi> was.</p>
               <p>The fruit of Chriſts Aſcenſion into Heauen, is our comming thither, as ſhall appeare more at large hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.

               </p>
               <p>Of his Glorie the ſame is manifeſt, in that this verie ſetting at the right hand of God is

               </p>
               <p>The fruit of his ſetting at the right hand of God is very great, and in a manner all in all, both for his Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion

               <p>Generally, in his Kingdome, I obſerue three things:<note place="margin">Kingdome,</note>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, A calling of Chriſt by God his Father to it: for as hee intruded not himſelfe into the Office of a Prieſt, but expected the calling of his Father: ſo he tooke not vpon him to raigne, before hee had a Kingdome giuen him. Therefore, <hi>Pſalme</hi> 2. 6.

And PETER <note n="z" place="margin">Acts 2. 36.</note> 
                  <hi>Him hath God made both Lord and Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, The inueſting of him into the Princely Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Adminiſtration of his Kingdome, whereof he had full ſeizin, and was put into the actuall and reall poſſeſſion of it, when he aſcended into Heauen, which a man may call his going vp vnto his Coronation. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi>
                  <note n="a" place="margin">Dan. 7. 13, 14</note> in his ſeuenth Chapter hath a notable deſcription of it, ſeeing in a Viſion, Chriſt, God and Man, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming out of Heauen into the lower parts of the Earth, to worke the myſterie of our Redemption; and, that done, aſcending into Heauen to the Ancient of dayes (God his Father) to preſent himſelfe before him. <hi>And to him,</hi> ſaith hee, <hi>was giuen Dominion, Glorie, and a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, The fruit and end of all this, the ſame where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto<note place="margin">is in the things which he doth from God for thoſe Elect:</note> the whole worke of his Mediation tendeth, which is our <note n="b" place="margin">

                  <hi>Prince of Peace,</hi> 
                  <note n="d" place="margin">Heb. 7. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>The King of Righteouſneſſe, and The King of Peace, figured by</hi> MELCHISEDECH <hi>King of Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem.</hi> And heereupon the <note n="e" place="margin">Rom. 14. 17.</note> Apoſtle ſaith, that <hi>the Kingdome of God is Righteouſneſſe, Peace, and loy in the Holy Ghost.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="334" facs="tcp:29324:181"/>
               <p>More ſpecially to treat of this his Kingdome; It par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth<note place="margin">The kingdome of Chriſt hath two parts.</note> it ſelfe into three mayne Armes or Branches, riſing by ſo many ſteps or ſtayres; one is his Gouernment of the World in generall, taking things in ſuch ſort as the Fall did leaue them, without vouchſafing any further fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour. And this may bee called the footſtoole of his Kingdome. Another ſtandeth in the beſtowing of his Word, and the fruits thereof, matters of ſpeciall grace, though ſuch as fall vpon the Reprobate: and this may be called the Scepter of his Kingdome.</p>
               <p>The third, Is the giuing of his Spirit; whereby, of carnall, he maketh vs ſpirituall and heauenly Creatures: and this may be called the Seate and Throne, or rather the Life and Power of his Kingdome: as theſe three parts are ſo diſtinguiſhed, and in the ſame order, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 93.</p>
               <p>The firſt words of which Pſalme in a holy triumph, and reioycing-wiſe expreſſe the generall argument, that <hi>Iehouah,</hi> which is Chriſt our Lord, <hi>raigneth,</hi> and not raigneth onely, but hath his Raigne accompanied with two Noble Adiuncts; <hi>Glorie and Power.</hi> Then hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to diſtinguiſh the parts; Firſt, his Gouernment of the World, conſidered in two degrees: One, the ſtay and ſuſtentation of all things, the ſame which the
<note n="f" place="margin">Heb. 1. 3</note> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſo highly magnifieth to the <hi>Hebrewes:</hi> for where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as <hi>Adams</hi> ſinne had turned vpſide downe the whole frame of Nature, and, according to the curſe, <hi>What day thou eateſt of the forbidden fruit, thou ſhalt certainly dye,</hi> had brought man and all the Creatures, for mans ſake, to vtter ruine and deſolation, Chriſt the Mediator ſteppeth forth, and there beginneth his Kingdome, in holding vp the World, which otherwiſe had inſtantly come to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. This you haue in the latter end of the firſt Verſe: <hi>The inhabited World is ſettled, it ſhall not be remoued.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And that ſo wonderfull a thing as this, a worke of ſuch admiration, might haue a reaſon ſutable, to make it not ſeeme ſtrange, the Prophet telleth vs, that Hee,
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:29324:181"/> which vpon <hi>Adams</hi> fall began his Mediation, had a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing long before, and together with his Father and Holy Spirit weilded a greater Scepter, being the Lord and Creatour of <hi>Adams</hi> ſelfe, and of the whole World be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, and the great King, out of whoſe Throne proceed thoſe euerlaſting counſels, that rule and moderate what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer is or ſhall be, <hi>Thy Throne is eſtabliſhed before any time: thou art from euerlaſting.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The other degree is in the tayming, and bringing downe of the proud enemies of his Kingdome, whoſe rage and furie hee compareth with the loud noyſe of mightie waters, when the Waues and Surges of the Sea ariſe: Chriſts Dominion, that ſitteth aloft, as Lord Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amount, with the ſtilling and ouer-ruling of them.</p>
               <p>Then followeth the ſecond mayne Arme and Branch of his Kingdome, in the Scepter of his Word: <hi>Thy teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies are exceeding true.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And laſtly, the euerlaſting Righteouſneſſe, which, by the Spirit of Sanctification, hee beſtoweth vpon his Church: <hi>In thy Houſe is comely holineſſe, O</hi> IEHO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VAH, <hi>for euermore.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The firſt of theſe is properly called his Iudicature, or Office of a Iudge: the ſecond is his Propheticall Office; the third is wont by excellencie to be called The King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: All moſt glorious and noble effects of his Aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion into Heauen, and ſitting at the right hand of God, as the Apoſtle telleth vs, <hi>Epheſ. 4. 8. Aſcending on high, he led captiuitie captiue:</hi> (whereby he meaneth the abſolute power giuen vnto him for the gouernment of the World, ſeene ſpecially in the ſubduing of the proud e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies of the Church. <hi>And gaue gifts vnto men:</hi> which <note n="g" place="margin">Verſe 10.</note> by and by hee interpreteth to bee as much, as <hi>to fill all things,</hi> that is, the whole bodie of his Church, and all the parts of it, with the varietie of his Graces. Not that Chriſt had not this excellencie, or did not raigne at all before his Aſcenſion into Heauen: for <note n="h" place="margin">Iohn 1. 49.</note> 
                  <hi>Nathaniel</hi> tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:29324:182"/> him, <hi>Thou art the King of Iſrael.</hi> And <note n="i" place="margin">Iohn 18. 37.</note> hee him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, when <hi>Pilate</hi> asked, <hi>Art thou a King?</hi> anſwereth, <hi>Thou ſayest</hi> true: <hi>for I am a King.</hi> But the full and reall manifeſtation of this Kingdome, in his fleſh or humane nature, did then firſt beginne.</p>
               <p>To proſecute now theſe parts in ſuch order, as wee<note place="margin">One whereby he gouerneth all the World according to their owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſince the fall.</note> did propound them.</p>
               <p>The firſt is that, which extendeth generally to all the World, and to the whole gouernment, and adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it, which hee himſelfe is wont to call his Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, or Office of iudging, <hi>Iohn 5. 27. He hath giuen vnto him dignitie to execute iudgement, as he is the Sonne of man,</hi> And <hi>Iohn 5. 22.

God therefore, who before gouerned immediately and by himſelfe, hath, euer ſince the fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> appointed Chriſt his Vicegerent, and Lieutenant generall, in whoſe perſon he would afterwards rule the World: Not that himſelf ſitteth idle in heauen, as <hi>Ioſephs</hi> Maſter did, when he had committed vnto <hi>Ioſeph</hi> the Adminiſtration of his houſe: but being in him, and with him, and working all things by and through Chriſt, who againe vſeth to that end, beſide his Spirit, and the power of his Word, the ſeruice alſo &amp; the miniſtery of his holy Angels: all which is figured by many excellent and goodly Similitudes, in the Viſion of <note n="k" place="margin">Ezech. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>Ezechiel,</hi> where the foure liuing Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures repreſenting the innumerable company of Angels, whoſe Miniſterie extendeth vnto all the foure parts of the Earth, haue vnder their feet foure wheeles; noting
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:29324:182"/> the whole vncertaine courſe of this changeable and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtant world, which moue when they moue, and reſt when they ſtand ſtill. And when the liuing creatures lift vp themſelues from earth into heauen, to receiue from God new Commandements, the wheeles alſo, as it were, doe follow them, and ceaſe from wheeling, to wait their direction. Aboue which Angels is a Curtaine, or Extent betweene God and them, all of Chriſtal, cleare and tranſparent: thorow the which as he beholdeth theſe inferior creatures, ſo they, both Angels and men, according to their mediocritie, are able to ſee him, and the brightneſſe of his glorie. Ouer that Extent, higher than the higheſt heauens, is a moſt glorious Throne e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect: whereupon doth ſit the likeneſſe of the Sonne of man, Chriſt the bleſſed Lord of glorie, God and man, whom all obey, and ſtoope at his command. All this for the good of his Church and people, for whoſe ſake it was neceſſarie he ſhould be armed with ſo great a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand and Power.</p>
               <p>In this part of his Kingdome, I note</p>
               <p>Firſt, The largeneſſe thereof, in that it reacheth euery where, and no place exempted from it: <hi>I will giue the Nations</hi> 
                  <note n="l" place="margin">Pſ. 2. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>for thine inheritance, and the ends of the earth for thy poſſeſſion.</hi> 
                  <note n="m" place="margin">Zach. 9. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>His dominion ſhall be from Sea to Sea, and from the Riuer, vnto the ends of the earth.</hi>

                  <hi>And to him was giuen Dominion, and a Glorie, and a Kingdome, that all people, nations, and tongues ſhould ſerue him.</hi> 
                  <note n="o" place="margin">Pſ. 72. 8. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>He ſhal beare rule from one Sea vnto another, and from the floud, as farre as the ends of the earth. All Kings ſhall bow downe vnto him, and all Nations ſhall ſerue him.</hi>

               <p>Secondly, In this Kingdome Chriſt alone perfecteth all things, not like to other Kings and Potentates, who rule by deputies; but here hee himſelfe doth all: for though there he vſed inſtruments, yet all commeth from his ſtrength and vertue, and hee himſelfe is euery-where preſent by his Spirit: Whereupon his Kingdome is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led

               <p>Thirdly, the vertues and properties of this our King, arming and inabling him for the effecting of thoſe great things, are two; Counſell, to aduiſe of things wiſely, and Strength, to put them in execution, beeing both the ſtayes and props of a Kingdome, as it were the two pillers, <hi>Iacin</hi> and <hi>Bohas,</hi> whereupon <note n="r" place="margin">1.

                  <hi>From guile and violence hee ſhall deliuer their ſoules.</hi>

               <pb n="339" facs="tcp:29324:183"/>
               <p>Fourthly, the qualitie and manner of his adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is in

               <p>Fiftly, The fruit of this adminiſtration is peace, that is to ſay, all manner of bleſſings and good things vnto his people, <hi>Pſal. 72. 3.

               <p>For the beter vnderſtanding of the former Doctrine,<note place="margin">In the Angels perfect:</note> concerning the generalitie of Chriſts gouernement ouer all the creatures, and for a more comfortable vſe of it, conſider we the diſtribution which hee himſelfe gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth of the creatures, ouer whom he ſo commandeth: When hee ſaith, <note n="l" place="margin">Math. 28. 18.</note> 
                  <hi>All Dignitie,</hi> that is to ſay, Power, Preeminence, Rule, and Authoritie, <hi>is giuen vnto me in heauen, and vpon the earth,</hi> meaning ouer Angels, men, and all other creatures.</p>
               <p>His gouernement of the Angels ſtandeth in theſe poynts.</p>
               <p>Firſt, He is the Lord, and they his vaſſals, whom hee commandeth and ruleth at his pleaſure: whereupon they are called, <note n="m" place="margin">Reu. 19. 10. &amp; 22. 19.</note>

               </p>
               <p>Secondly, He teacheth and informeth them the will of his Father, which they by their owne ſtrength or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrie are not able to reach vnto: Wherefore in <note n="n" place="margin">Dan. 8. 13.</note>

               <p>Thirdly, He holds them vp in that integritie and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:29324:184"/> of Nature wherein they ſtand, neuer to fall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way; for which cauſe they are <note n="p" place="margin">1.

               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, Hee vſeth their miniſterie and ſeruice in the Gouernment of the World, as wee noted before out of the Viſion of <note n="r" place="margin">Ezech. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>Ezechiel.</hi>
               </p>

               <p>Secondly, Either for the triall of his children, or plaguing of the wicked, as to himſelfe it ſeemeth beſt, he giueth them ſometimes releaſe of their torments, and looſeth them out of thoſe chaines and fetters of darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe wherewith they are held faſt. Hence it is, that <hi>Luke</hi> 8. 32. they beſought this Ieſus, not to charge them to depart into the Deepe. And this benefit the Deuils themſelues haue from Chriſt, for the good of his Church, and the working of his glorie.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, He reſtrayneth and bridleth them, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all their rage and malice, they cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the bounds that hee hath ſet, and when they haue done all they can, they bring to paſſe but his good will and pleaſure.

               <p>Fourthly, The ſubduing and conquering of them: for <note n="t" place="margin">1. Co. 15. 24, 25</note> 
                  <hi>hee ſhall aboliſh all Principalitie, and all Dignitie, and Might, being to raigne till hee haue put all enemies vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his feet.</hi> As

               <p>Fiftly, The iudging of them in the latter Day, which the vncleane ſpirits themſelues acknowledge and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe: when they expoſtulate the matter with him, <hi>Art thou come to torment vs before the time, Mat.</hi> 8. 29.</p>

This is hee that lighteneth euery man that commeth into the World.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Specially towards the Reprobate is the ſame in all points, that is to Satan their head, that is to ſay:</p>
               <p>Firſt, A perpetuall obduration and hardening of their hearts vnto finall vnrepentance: for ſo the <note n="y" place="margin">Iohn 12. 39, 40, 41.</note> Euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſt <hi>Iohn,</hi> when hee had ſhewed that the Iewes could not beleeue, becauſe <hi>Eſay</hi> had ſaid, <hi>He hath blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart, leſt they ſhould ſee with their eyes, and vnderſtand with their heart, and I ſhould heale them.</hi> Immediately hee addeth, <hi>Theſe things ſaid</hi> ESAIAS, <hi>when he ſaw his glorie, and ſpake of him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, The reſtrayning and bridling of them, that notwithſtanding all their rage and furie, they cannot go beyond his appointed Liſts, as wee ſee in <note n="z" place="margin">Acts 9. 1. &amp;c.</note> 
                  <hi>Saul,</hi> who breathing out threatning and ſlaughter after the death of <hi>Stephen,</hi> went with full ſwindge to <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> to caſt into Priſon all that called vpon the Name of <hi>Ieſus:</hi> but hee in the verie way meeting with him, reſtrayneth his malice, and changeth his heart, to profeſſe the Truth which before hee perſecuted.

               <p>Secondly, Becauſe thoſe wherein the Propheticall Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice<note place="margin">Propheticall Office,</note> is thought to conſiſt, Teaching, Preaching, Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring of the Sacraments, Diſcipline and ſuch like, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto Miracles come alſo to bee annexed, are matters of Authoritie, and of Power deriued from his Kingly Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice; and his Word is called, <hi>The</hi> 
                  <note n="e" place="margin">Mat. 13. 19.</note> 
                  <hi>Word of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome:</hi> yea, the preaching of the Goſpell, and the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Church collected and gathered by the ſame, hath the name of <note n="f" place="margin">Mat. 13. 24, 47, 52.</note> 
                  <hi>the Kingdome of Heauen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, Since the Miniſterie of Chriſt hath alwayes going with it, an effectuall and liuely working of his Spirit, as one ſpeciall part of this Propheticall Office, his Miniſterie muſt needes bee a Noble and a Royall Dignity, that is accompayned with ſo great a force and power.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, It is by vertue of his Kingly Office, that he ſendeth forth Prophets and Apoſtles, and all other Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, prooued <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 8, 11, 12. where <hi>Paul</hi> deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing the Royaltie of his Kingdome, <hi>that hee led captiui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie captiue, and gaue gifts vnto men,</hi> immediatly addeth, <hi>He therefore gaue ſome to be Apoſtles, ſome to bee Euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts, ſome Prophets, ſome Paſters and Teachers, for the knit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting together of the Saints for the worke of the Miniſterie, for the building vp of the Body of Chriſt.</hi> But this, all muſt grant that he doth, as the Head of the Prophets. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Propheticall Office, is one part of his Kingly bountie.</p>
               <p>And albeit Teaching may ſeeme a part of the Prieſtly Function, by that which is written, <hi>Deut. 33. 10. They teach</hi> IACOB <hi>thy Iudgements, and Iſrael thy Law;</hi> yet the eſſentiall point of the Prieſts Office, which ſtood in Sacrifices and Oblations, muſt bee diſtinguiſhed from that common, to the whole Tribe of <hi>Leui,</hi> as in that very place the words following doe diſtinguiſh them: <hi>They put Incenſe before thy face, and Sacrifice wholy to bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed vpon thine Altar:</hi> for as Prieſts they went no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:29324:186"/> then to doe, and to be types of thoſe things which before were aſſigned vnto the Prieſt-hood of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Their Office of teaching and inſtructing the people: they had another calling for common with the Tribe of <hi>Leui,</hi> which the Prophets elſe, who were not of the ſame Tribe, yet tooke vpon them being rayſed vp (extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily) for that purpoſe, from whom this part of Chriſts Office tooke the name, and not from the Prieſtly Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, though they were alſo called of GOD vnto it.</p>
               <p>The Propheticall Office of Chriſt reſpecteth a Church<note place="margin">Which is to the Church of Profeſſors: it ſtandeth in an outward cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and gifts: An outward calling, when by his Word, that is to ſay, his publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant of Grace.</note> and people, in beſtowing vpon them his Word, and the fruit it bringeth forth by the working of his Spirit: for theſe three, <hi>Prophet, Word,</hi> and <hi>Church,</hi> haue a perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all relation one vnto another. Wherefore in handling the Propheticall Office, the Word of Chriſt is firſt to be ſpoken of, and then his Church.</p>
               <p>The Word of Chriſt is all the holy Doctrine that hee hath taught from the beginning, concerning our ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion through him:</p>
               <p>Wherein obſerue,</p>
               <p>Firſt, Chriſt is the matter, and onely ſubiect, and ſubſtance of the Word. In that regard, himſelfe is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>The</hi>

                  <hi>The Word of God:</hi> Becauſe of him, and of him alone it is, that there are in the Word ſo many glorious and excellent ſpeeches, and the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of the Goſpell hath the name of the Word of Chriſt, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 16. So as it is not any naturall knowledge that this Doctrine teacheth, but heauenly and ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall which was not in <hi>Adam</hi> before his fall, though he were perfectly holy, and endued with all manner of naturall vnderſtanding.</p>
               <p>Secondly, He himſelfe, as he is the matter, ſo he is the Authour of the Word. In which reſpect the Scripture giueth theſe names vnto him.</p>
               <p>Firſt, He is called <hi>Hamedabber, or the Speaker,</hi> and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter of his Fathers Will, <hi>Dan.</hi> 8. 13. To which
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:29324:187"/> place, it may be, the Apoſtle <note n="i" place="margin">Heb. 12. 25.</note> hath ſome eye, when hee ſaith, <hi>Take heed yee reiect not him that ſpeaketh, or the Speaker,</hi> meaning Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>A Doctor,</hi> 
                  <note n="k" place="margin">Mat. 3. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>or a Teacher.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>A</hi>

                  <hi>Prophet,</hi> the head and Lord of the Prophets.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, an <note n="m" place="margin">Heb. 3. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>Apoſtle.</hi>
               </p>

                  <hi>Angell of the Couenant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And that wee may know with what Graces our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Chriſt is furniſhed, for
<note n="o" place="margin">Col. 2. 3.</note> ſo great a worke, <hi>all the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of Knowledge and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderstanding are hidden in him,</hi> yea, he is <hi>Wiſdome</hi>
                  <note n="p" place="margin">1. Cor. 1. 24.</note> 
                  <hi>it ſelfe, or</hi>

               <p>Wherefore here is the Touch-ſtone of all Truth, and there is no truth concerning God and our Saluation in Chriſt, but in the Word, our Sauiour himſelfe bearing record, <hi>Iohn 17. 17. Thy word is Truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Touching the outward inſtruments which it hath pleaſed him to vſe in the deliuerie of this Word; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he ſpake by his owne voyce from Heauen; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by the Miniſterie of his holy Angels: But ſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this outward Miniſterie is either his owne which hee executed perſonally himſelfe, when hee was vpon the Earth, (deſcribed <hi>Eſay</hi> 42. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. in regard whereof he is called a Miniſter, <note n="ſ" place="margin">Rom. 15. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>The Miniſter of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion,</hi> and a <note n="t" place="margin">Eſay 42. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>Seruant:</hi>) or it is of his Seruants from the beginning of the World, of whom hee ſaith, <hi>He</hi> 
                  <note n="u" place="margin">
                     <hi>Luke</hi> 10<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 16.</note> 
                  <hi>that heareth you, heareth mee; and hee that reiecteth you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> reiecteth me.</hi> Of whoſe Miniſteries and Functions we ſhall haue cauſe to ſpeake hereafter.</p>
               <p>Therefore Chriſts Office of a Teacher did not firſt begin when hee tooke our fleſh vpon him: for his Spirit it was that ſpake in the Prophets, long before hee came
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:29324:187"/> into the World, as the Apoſtle beareth record, 1. <hi>Pet. 1. 11. The forewitneſſing Spirit of Chriſt that was in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, declared the ſufferings that ſhould befall Chriſt, and the glorie that was to follow.</hi> And that which is in the Pſalmes, <note n="x" place="margin">Pſal. 95. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>To day if ye will heare his voyce:</hi> the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle <note n="y" place="margin">Heb. 3. 7.</note> to the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> referreth to the voyce of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, I note the perfection of this Doctrine, that Chriſt hath opened the whole will of his Father fully and perfectly in euery Age, and neuer left his Church without a full and perfect direction of all things neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie for their ſaluation: for <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaith,
<note n="z" place="margin">Deut. 30. 15.</note> 
                  <hi>Behold, I ſet before you this day life and death:</hi> which hee could not haue ſaid, vnleſſe there had beene a certaine direction to lead them vnto life. And when hee chargeth <note n="a" place="margin">Deut. 4. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>Not to adde to the words that he gaue them in Commandement, nor to take from them,</hi> doth it not prooue that the ſame was perfect?</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The ſubiect of the Word being Chriſt, it is more particularly the Couenant made in him, which by the Word is promulged and offered vnto all, and his Spirit maketh effectuall to as many as receiuing the ſame by faith, make themſelues worthy of it.</p>
               <p>The which Couenant being diſtinguiſhed by the Old<note place="margin">(which being of the Old Teſtament, was called The promiſe; of the New, The Goſpell)</note> Teſtament and the New, as before hath beene declared, the publication of the Old Teſtament in and through Chriſt to come, was called <note n="b" place="margin">Acts 13. 32. Gal. 3. 17.</note> 
                  <hi>The Promiſe;</hi> when hee was exhibited and come indeed, that worthy and wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Meſſage was termed

                  <hi>The Goſpell,</hi> or good newes, and glad tydings.</p>
               <p>But it is the glory of Chriſts adminiſtration, whether in his owne perſon when hee was among vs, or by his<note place="margin">and by the power of his Spirit,</note> Seruants, that the outward diſpenſing of the Word is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with an inward working of the Spirit: of both which parts his Propheticall Office ſtandeth, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in differing from all other Miniſters, who onely preach the Word, ſet <note n="d" place="margin">Mat. 3. 11.</note> on the outward Element,

                  </note> or an outward ſeparation. But the outward Church is it which wee are to beginne withall, which is in generall the whole number of men profeſſing Chriſt. Concerning which take theſe few things,</p>
               <p>Firſt, Grace is not vniuerſall, nor all doe not receiue it, no, not ſo much as the offer of Grace, (nor an outward calling.) <hi>Many,</hi> 
                  <note n="l" place="margin">Mat. 20. 16.</note> ſaith our Sauiour Chriſt, <hi>are called:</hi> he ſaith not all, but many. And ſo the
<note n="m" place="margin">Mat. 22. 3, 4</note> King which made a Marriage Dinner for his Sonne, ſent his Seruants to call, not all, but <hi>thoſe that hee had called:</hi> that is, thoſe whoſe names he had ſet downe in a Calender or Roll to bee his Gheſts, although of thoſe alſo ſome <note n="n" place="margin">Ver. 11, 12, 13</note> were none of his. Neither doth it hinder this which is ſaid af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <note n="o" place="margin">Ver. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>Go into the high-wayes, and bring in as many as ye ſhal find.</hi> For the ſcope of the Parable ſheweth, that by thoſe that were firſt bid, are meant the Iewes, into whoſe place came the Gentiles, that before were alieus and ſtrangers; ſo that by calling of the Iewes onely at the firſt, it is prooued that all men are not made partakers of the outward calling. And this, if wee had no word at all for it, experience it ſelfe might teach vs; for how many hath death ouer-taken in thier Cradles, before they could bee called? how many of riper yeeres doth
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:29324:188"/> darkneſſe couer, that they neuer can ſee the Light? <hi>Paul</hi> verily <note n="p" place="margin">Acts 14. 15.</note> ſaying, that <hi>in the ages paſſed, God ſuffered all Nations to walke in their owne wayes,</hi> ſheweth, how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Millions of ſoules haue periſhed, that neuer heard of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>But it is the glorie of Chriſts adminiſtration, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in his owne perſon, when he was among vs, or by his ſeruants, that the outward diſpenſing of the Word is accompanied with an inward working of the Spirit: of both which parts, his Propheticall Office ſtandeth, herein differing from all other Miniſters, who onely preach the Word, <note n="q" place="margin">Mat. 3. 11.</note> ſet on the outward Element, <note n="r" place="margin">1. Cor. 3. 6.</note> plant, and water, but the whole bleſſing doth come from him; for he teaching, <note n="ſ" place="margin">Luke 24. 45.</note> openeth mens minds, <hi>that they may vnderſtand the Scriptures,</hi> and beſtoweth other graces which the Word bringeth forth, not onely in his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, but euen in the wicked.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It is the inſtinct and motion of Gods Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, that draweth a man to this Profeſſion, <hi>Gen. 9. 27. God perſwade</hi> IAPHETH, <hi>that hee may dwell in the Tents of</hi> SHEM: for all the naturall Wiſdome of the World is not able to leade vs by the hand to Chriſt, nor to teach vs the knowledge of heauenly things. I ſay not, the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing knowledge of Gods Elect, but not ſo much as that outward knowledge and profeſſion, and thoſe common graces which many of the Reprobates doe attayne vnto. <hi>No man,</hi> ſaith IESVS, <hi>is the Lord, but by the Spirit of God, 1.

And ſo doth the Apoſtle there goe thorow the reſt of the parts; <hi>Gifts</hi> of knowledge, <hi>Faculties and Miniſteries: All which,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>one and the ſame Spirit worketh.</hi> And what need we much to labour herein, when the very hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of this ſacred Doctrine ſo many yeeres, from all the deepe and wiſe men of the Earth, whileſt the Iewes had it alone; and at this day, from ſo many famous

               <p>And this which is the firſt and meaneſt of Gods fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours, is yet a fauour not to bee contemned, it being an excellent and a glorious thing to bee (though but out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly) Profeſſors of Chriſt: for</p>
               <p>Firſt, Hereby they are ſeuered from Turkes, Pagans and Heathen men, and in name are become Chriſtians: for that title the <note n="t" place="margin">Acts 11. 26.</note> Holy Ghoſt giueth to all Profeſſors.</p>
               <p>Secondly, They are now receiued into the LORDS Houſe, and are ſaid to bee <hi>within:</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, Being members of the viſible Church, dwelling with and among them, they are made parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of many goodly graces, and benefits, which God powreth vpon his Church; euen vpon the Reprobate and wicked, for the Elects ſake that are among them, as the Pſalmiſt ſaith, that

               <p>The third thing is, it ſufficeth for the making of a Church, if they bee Profeſſors onely, this being but a bare outward calling common to the Reprobate.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, They muſt bee Profeſſors of Chriſt, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing that in words, the hauing whereof indeed ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth men truly Chriſtians. So the Apoſtle defineth it, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. 1. where, in ſtead of naming the Church of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſus</hi> (for to the outward Church he writeth) hee vſeth this <hi>Periphraſis</hi> to <hi>the Saints that are in Epheſus, and to the faithfull in Chriſt Ieſus:</hi> and 1. <hi>Cor. 1. 2.

                        </gap>, 4. Howbeit we ſay, the Church of God is Catholike or Vniuerſall, but in a farre other ſence then they meane by their vniuerſalitie which they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend of a general ſpreading of itſelfe, without any great oppoſition to the contrarie in beautie and much braue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, and multitudes of men glittering and ſhining in the World, whereas we ſay, The true Church of Chriſt is Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike or Vniuerſall, becauſe it is not tyed to any one particular place or Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, as ſometimes among the Iewes it was; but in euery Nation God hath thoſe that feare him, and belong to his Election. Not alwayes viſible, and to bee ſeene with the eye, but members through faith, of the true Catholike and inuiſible Church of Chriſt. The Papiſts which ſay the Church cannot erre.</p>
                  </note> Church ſoeuer in ſuch ſort profeſſeth Chriſt, as the members truely holding that they doe profeſſe, are thereby made members of the Myſticall Bodie of Chriſt, the ſame, what imperfections ſoeuer it haue beſide, and how vnſound ſoeuer it may bee in many parts, yet it hath the heart and life of a Church: o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe it cannot bee ſaid a Church. For albeit the Church of God be not ſubiect to fundamentall errours, that take away the life and being of a Church; for then how could it bee any Church at all? yet in other points, not of manners onely, but of Truth and Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it doth and may erre, both particular Congregations &amp; the whole Church Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſall
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:29324:191"/> did not the whole Church of the Iewes erre. And euen they that heard our Sauiour, Chriſt ſo long, when they dreamed of the Kingdome of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> to be an earthly <note n="y" place="margin">Acts 1. 15.</note> Kingdome, and that it ſhould come in brauerie and oſtentation. And was it not the <note n="z" place="margin">Acts 10. 34. &amp; 11. 2.</note> common errour of al the Church, and of the Apoſtles themſelues, after his Aſcenſion, that they thought the Gentiles to be vncleane, and that the Goſpell pertayned not to them?</p>
               <p>Fundamentall errours I call theſe two eſpecially:</p>
               <p>Firſt, When the Doctrine and Profeſſion of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell is corrupt in ſubſtance; as the Papiſts doe corrupt it three manner of wayes;</p>
               <p>Firſt, Denying Iuſtification by faith alone in the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Merits of Chriſt, and ſeeking to bee ſaued by their owne Merits or Righteouſneſſe, for which cauſe the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle caſteth off the Iewes, <hi>Rom. 10. 3. and</hi> 11. 20. and threatneth aſmuch to the <hi>Galatians, Gal. 5. 2. If yee bee circumciſed</hi> (ioyning Circumciſion, or the workes of the Law together with Chriſt in the matter of Iuſtification) <hi>Chriſt ſhall profit you nothing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, Denying the ſole ſufficient Sacrifice of Chriſt, and ſetting vp in their blaſphemous Maſſe, a dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reall ſacrifice of his bodie for the quick and the dead; whereas Chriſts Sacrifice muſt either bee a perfect Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice once for all, neuer to be iterated nor repeated, or elſe it is no Sacrifice at all, as the Apoſtle teacheth at large in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrewes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, Denying the true and onely Head-ſhip of Chriſt, by placing Antichriſt in his roome, which is a mayne and fundamentall Hereſie, <hi>not to hold fast the head, Col.</hi> 2. 19.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Idolatrie, when the Worſhip of God is corrupted in the verie ſubſtance of it: In which ſort, the old Church of the Iewes corrupting themſelues, <note n="a" place="margin">Exod. 32. 7.</note> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came no more the People of God; and had their <note n="b" place="margin">Exod. 33. 3, 7, 11.</note> Bill
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:29324:191"/> of Diuorce for it, <note n="c" place="margin">Exod. 32. 30 31, 32, 33, 34.</note> till at <hi>Moſes</hi> interceſſion vpon the publike Repentance of the people, it pleaſed God to be reconciled to them. And herein alſo the Papiſts doe of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend as grieuouſly and more groſſely then euer the <hi>Iewes</hi> did, in worſhipping of Images, of Saints deceaſed, and of their breaden god in that their Idolatrous Maſſe.</p>
               <p>By all which it is euident, that the Church of Rome is a corrupt and vnſound Church, if a Church at all. For touching the Sacraments, and other holy things, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Prophanations of the ſame which are to bee found among them (for in truth, out of the Church there are not any Sacraments rightly adminiſtred) they can no more make a true Church, then the bare writing and ſetting to of a Seale, can make a Deed, without the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties deliuerie: for God neuer deliuered his Sacraments to any out of his Church, though they preſume to take them, and to ſet, as it were, his Scale to them. And where the Apoſtle ſaith, 2. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. 4. that <hi>Antichriſt muſt ſit in the Temple</hi> or Church of God, hee meaneth that which once was the Church of God, though now it bee not. Like to the ſpeech of our Sauiour Chriſt, <hi>Mat. 24. 15. When you ſee the abomination of deſolation, ſtanding in the holy place,</hi> that is, the place which once was holy, whileſt it was a figure of Chriſt and of his Church: but ſo was it not, when this which hee fore-telleth ſhould come to paſſe. But what are wee to doe in theſe caſes? Surely where the errour is dangerous, and ouerthroweth the foundation, wee are there to ſeuer our ſelues, and to haue no fellowſhip with them, as wee are taught in the caſe of erronious doctrine, 1. <hi>Tim. 6. 3. If any man teach otherwiſe, and conſent not to the wholeſome words of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, and to the Doctrine which is according to God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, he is puffed vp; from ſuch ſeparate your ſelues.</hi> Hee himſelfe that taught this Leſſon, made no bones to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctize it, <hi>Acts 19. 9. When certaine men at Epheſus were har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened, and diſobeyed, ſpeaking euill of the way of God, hee
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:29324:192"/> departed from them, and ſeparated the Diſciples.</hi> And the like he did at <hi>Rome, Acts</hi> 28. 28. Of the other, that is to ſay, Idolatrie, we haue a Commandement, 2. <hi>Cor. 6. 14, 15. 16, 17. Bee not vnequally yoked with Infidels: for what fellowſhip hath Righteouſneſſe with vnrighteouſneſſe, or what communion hath light with darkneſſe? or what concord hath Chriſt with</hi> BELIAL? <hi>or what part hath the Beleeuer with the Infidell? or what agreement hath the Temple of God with Idols? Wherefore come out from among them, and ſeparate your ſelues, ſaith the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So did the Prieſts and Leuites come to <hi>Iudah</hi> and <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi> to ſerue God, when <hi>Ieroboam</hi> had ſet vp Idols in <hi>Iſrael, 2. Chron.</hi> 11. 14. Worthily therefore in both theſe regards, and by good warrant from the Word, haue wee ſeparated our ſelues from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as from a Strumpet and a Harlot, not in any reſpect the true Spouſe of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>But for other blemiſhes or corruptions that onely ſtayne and disfigure the Church, but ſtrike not at the heart and roote, there to make ſeparation, is a grieuous offence, and the ſinne of Schiſmatikes.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Being but the Church of them that are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with an outward calling, there are among them of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes many Hypocrites, as the Apoſtle teacheth, 1. <hi>Iohn 2. 1, 19: They went out from vs, but they were not of vs: for if they had beene of vs, they would haue abidden with vs. But this is to make it manifeſt, that all are not of vs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Vpon all that hath beene ſaid, it followeth, that the Church which now wee ſpeake of, is a Church viſible. I call it not viſible, as if the Church of GOD were alwayes to bee ſeene and knowne in the<note place="margin">The errour of Poperie, that would haue the Church of God, to be alwayes viſible in the World.</note> World: for as the Moone is ſometimes eclipſed, ſometimes at the full: ſo the Church, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times lifted vp aboue the Mountaines, is other ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:29324:192"/> thruſt into the Wilderneſſe, <note n="c" place="margin">Reu. 12. 6.</note> that no true Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors ſeeme to be remayning. So 2. <hi>Chro. 15. 3. Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> by which is meant not the ten Tribes onely, but <hi>Iudah</hi> and <hi>Beniamin,</hi> as the ſequel of the Chapter ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, is ſaid to haue beene a long time <hi>without the true God without Prieſt to teach, without the Law.</hi> And <hi>Paul, 2. Theſſ.</hi> 2. 3. telleth of a generall defection and falling from the Truth, that no face of a viſible Church ſhould be diſcerned: Antichriſt ſhould ſo vniuerſally ſet vp his throne, which in the height and fulneſſe of Poperie we ſee to haue bin accompliſhed: Although that God hath, and alwaies had ſome that are his, as appeareth by that which the Lord
<note n="d" place="margin">Rom. 11. 2, 3.</note> anſwered to <hi>Elias.</hi> But I call it a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Church, becauſe it may be ſeene and knowne who are ſuch Profeſſors, though the Church of the Elect can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſeene. This outward Church vniuerſall, is fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther<note place="margin">Seuerall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies that aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble for the exerciſes of the Word, are ſo many Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches &amp; mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the whole.</note> to be conſidered in the beautie it receiueth by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies and aſſemblies, drawne by the power of Chriſts Spirit, to aſſociate and ioyne themſelues together in the profeſſion of his Name: which is a ſingular ornament and a marueilous gracing of the whole, thus to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed into particular meetings, as it were, the field of the Lord into ſeuerall cloſures, or a garden in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſeuerall beds or alleyes. Whereby Gods glory is much the more conſpicuous.</p>
               <p>Such a Church or Congregation (for ſo in ordinary ſenſe the Scripture vſeth the word Church) neither ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth of one or two, nor a few in a corner, but of many, enough to performe all ſeruices of the Church, and thoſe publiquely aſſembling. So the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of the <note n="e" place="margin">1. Cor. 11. 18.</note> Corinths, <hi>Comming together to the Church:</hi> and to the Hebrewes, <note n="f" place="margin">Heb. 10. 25.</note> 
                  <hi>Leaue not your aſſembling together, as the manner is of ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But not euery aſſembly of Profeſſors doth forth with make a Church, but their aſſembling in the name of Chriſt, for Prayer, Adminiſtration of the Sacraments, or other ſpirituall matters, whereby the Church is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:29324:193"/> from the Common-wealth and ciuill mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings. And this badge or marke our Sauiour ſetteth vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, <hi>Matth. 18. 20. Where two or three are gathered together in my name.</hi> And <hi>Paul 1. Cor. 1. 5. 4. 5. I haue decreed, when you and my Spirit are gathered together in the name of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, with the power of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, to deliuer ſuch a one to Satan.</hi> So wee read in the Acts, that <hi>the firſt day of the Weeke the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples gathered together to breake bread, Act.</hi> 20. 7.</p>
               <p>And not in vaine doe the Churches ſo aſſemble.

This ſhall be my Couenant with them, ſaith</hi> IEHOVAH, <hi>My Spirit that is in thee, and the words I haue put into thy mouth, ſhall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy ſeed, nor out of the mouth of thy ſeedes ſeede, ſaith</hi> IEHOVAH, <hi>from this time forth for euermore.</hi> Which promiſe our Sauiour hath alſo renued, <hi>Matth. 28. 19, 20. Goe therefore and gather Diſciples of all Nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Sonne, and of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt, teaching them to keepe all things whatſoeuer I haue commanded you.

               </p>
               <p>And of this inſtruction by word of mouth, it pleaſed God to make choyce, rather than of reading, for that it pierceth deeper into the heart and mind of man, and more doth affect him, and that through the bleſſing of God, who vſeth the zeale of the ſpeaker, for the quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and putting of life into that which is ſpoken. The argument, matter, or ſubiect muſt be of and concerning<note place="margin">in the Word of Chriſt;</note> Chriſt, by teaching our owne corruption and impoten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie to fulfill the Law; and therefore the neceſſitie wee haue to flye to him, who is made vnto vs of God, Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, Sanctification, and Redemption, that he that glorieth, might glorie in the Lord.

               <p>Sacraments or outward Signes and Seales of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant.<note place="margin">A Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t is</note> It hath the name <hi>Sacrament,</hi> from the Militarie Oath that Souldiers tooke to doe faithful ſeruice to their Captaine: for in like manner we in the Sacrament ſweare our Allegeance to Chriſt, and to fight vnder his Banner, againſt the World, the Fleſh and the Deuill. It is alſo called <hi>a Myſterie,</hi> or hidden thing, becauſe beſide the outward Signe, there is ſomewhat inward and Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall.</p>
               <p>In the definition of a Sacrament, I obſerue,</p>
               <p>Firſt, They are outward and earthly things to bee ſeene and felt, ſeruing for the helpe of our weakneſſe, which if wee were all Spirit, we needed not.</p>
               <p>Secondly, They are Signes, as it is ſaid, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 11.<note place="margin">a Signe</note> and <hi>Rom. 4. 11. The Signe of Circumciſion.</hi> PETER cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth them <hi>Types</hi> and Figures, 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 21. Therefore they ſerue as badges, to diſtinguiſh true Profeſſors from Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels and Heathen men; and as Monuments to bring hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly things to our remembrance. So ſaith our Sauiour Chriſt, <hi>Luke 19. 22. Doe this in remembrance of me.</hi> And the Apoſtle to the <note n="z" place="margin">1. Cor. 11. 26.</note> 
                  <hi>Corinths, As oft as yee eate this bread, and drinke this Cup, ye publiſh the Lords death till hee come.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, The end why God doth giue them, is, to be<note place="margin">and Seale of the Couenant,</note> not Signes onely, but Seales and Pledges for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion of our hearts, and to confirme and aſſure vnto vs thoſe ſpirituall and heauenly things, which alreadie
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:29324:195"/> wee haue and doe enioy, that is to ſay, Chriſt himſelfe, and conſequently, Iuſtification and Sanctification, and withall Saluation through him, as the Apoſtle teacheth, <hi>Rom. 4. 11. After, he receiued the Signe of Circumciſion, as a Seale of the Righteouſneſſe of the Faith which hee had when he was vncircumciſed, Acts 10. 47. Can any man keepe water away, that theſe ſhould not bee baptized, which haue receiued the holy Ghoſt aſwell as we?</hi> From whence we ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a noble vſe of the holy Sacraments proper to the faithfull: for where the viſible and outward Signe is common vnto all, yet being to other but bare and naked Signes, dead and fruitleſſe Ceremonies, that profit no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, becauſe they are not mixed with Faith in thoſe that doe receiue them: in the faithfull they ſeale vp and ratifie the very ſubſtance and effect of the Grace ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified, the Holy Ghoſt performing that in truth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in vs, which the outward Ceremonie, ioyned with the preaching of the Word, repreſenteth to our eyes.</p>
               <p>But albeit theſe things are, all of them, in euery Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament<note place="margin">either for our entrance or continuance in the Coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</note> ſet before vs, yet it is in ſeuerall and diſtinct manner: for of the Sacraments, ſome ſerue to ſeale vp &amp; aſſure our firſt ingraffing into Chriſt, and participation of Gods Couenant: ſome, our continuance and grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vp in him. In which two, all Graces are compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, They are to be adminiſtred, that is to ſay, to<note place="margin">The Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration,</note> be giuen and deliuered to the Church, and by the Church to be taken and receiued, <hi>Mat. 26. 26, 27. As they eate,</hi> IESVS <hi>tooke bread, and when hee had giuen thankes, hee brake it, and gaue to his Diſciples, and ſaid, Take, eate, &amp;c. And taking the Cup, and hauing giuen thankes, hee gaue vnto them, ſaying, Drinke ye all of it, &amp;c.</hi> Whereupon a Sacrament is not onely a Signe and a Seale, but a worke and an action.</p>
               <pb n="362" facs="tcp:29324:196"/>
               <p>This Adminiſtration of the Sacraments ſtandeth not<note place="margin">is to deliuer them with Prayer vnto God, to make the ſame effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall, to the end for the which they were orday<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: which the Scripture calleth <hi>Bleſſing</hi> or <hi>Conſecration.</hi>
                  </note> onely in reaching forth, and miniſtring the outward E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lement, but as is fitting for ſo holy an action, to conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate the ſame by the Word of God and Prayer; teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and declaring the end, the vſe, the nature, the inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the Sacrament, with Prayer made before, that God would bleſſe them for the helpe of our weakneſſe, to which end they were ordayned.</p>
               <p>This is it which is meant by <hi>bleſſing</hi> or<note place="margin">The Papiſts which hold Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration to bee the making of the Signe of the Croſſe, and the mum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling of a few words, whereby as by a Magicall Incantation, the Bread &amp; Wine ſhould be tranſubſtantiate.</note> 
                  <hi>conſecration,</hi> as may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare both by <note n="a" place="margin">Mat. 26. 26, 27. Mar. 14. 22, 23.</note> 
                  <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew</hi> and <hi>Marke,</hi> who after they had ſaid, IE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SVS <hi>tooke the bread and bleſſed,</hi> immediatly adde, <hi>and hee tooke the Cup and gaue thankes,</hi> making one of theſe words to expound the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The like is to bee ſeene in
<note n="b" place="margin">Luke 22. 17.</note> 
                  <hi>Luke,</hi> who leauing the word of <hi>bleſſing,</hi> contenteth himſelfe with that of gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of thankes. <hi>Paul</hi>
                  <note n="c" place="margin">1. Cor. 11. 24.</note> alſo reciting the Inſtitution, treadeth in <hi>Lukes</hi> ſteps. And ſo this word of <hi>Bleſſing</hi> is taken in diuers
<note n="d" place="margin">Mat. 14. 19. Mar. 6. 41. Luke 9. 16. 1. Cor. 11. 26, 27, 28.</note> other places: wee muſt not therefore imagine, that this Conſecration altereth the nature or ſubſtance of the Sacrament, it onely changeth the quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, in ſeparating them from a common to a holy. <hi>Paul,</hi> to make that out of queſtion, doth in one <note n="e" place="margin">1. Cor. 11.</note> Chapter, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Conſecration, thrice call it <hi>Bread.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Adminiſtration of the Sacraments being a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteriall action, ſo religiouſly to bee performed, all the Congregation haue their part in it. So it was vnder the Law, <hi>Exod. 12. 6. In the fourteenth day of this moneth, let all the Aſſembly of the Congregation of the Children of Iſrael kill the Paſſeouer in the twilight, Luke 1. 59. The eighth day the Neighbours and the Kinſmen of</hi> ELIZABETH <hi>came together to circumciſe the child.</hi> Our Sauiour, in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:29324:196"/> of the New Teſtament, doth obſerue the ſame, <hi>Mat. 26. 27. Drinke ye all of this.</hi> And the Apoſtle doth command, 1. <hi>Cor. 11. 33. When you come together,</hi> to eate the Supper of the Lord, <hi>wait one for another.</hi> Wherefore it is fit, that the place of their celebrating be the Church, or place where the Congregation vſually meeteth, and the time the Lords Day. So the Apoſtle (for the place) doth ſharply rebuke the <hi>Corinthians, 1. Cor.</hi> 11. 22. oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Church, as the onely place for Gods Sacraments to bee adminiſtred, vnto priuate houſes: <hi>Haue you not houſes to eate and drinke in? or deſpiſe you the Church of God?</hi> And for the time, wee finde the practice of the Church recorded, <hi>Acts</hi> 10. 7. that <hi>the firſt day of the weeke the Diſciples aſſembled together to breake bread.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From all that went before, theſe things may be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered:</p>
               <p>Firſt, The reſemblance and ſimilitude and (in all faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Receiuers) the inſeparable coniunction of theſe Signes and Seales, with the Graces ſignified and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed, whether you compare the things, or the Actions.</p>
               <p>The things, that is to ſay, the Element, or ſenſible and outward matter, with Chriſt and his benefits.</p>
               <p>The Actions, to wit, the deliuering of the Elements by the Miniſter, and our taking of it, which is the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Action, with Gods beſtowing his Sonne vpon vs, and all good things, and our (by faith) receiuing of him: by reaſon of both which, the Apoſtle ſaith, that in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme
<note n="f" place="margin">Gal. 3. 27.</note> 
                  <hi>we put on Chriſt,</hi> and that <hi>by</hi>
                  <note n="g" place="margin">1. Cor. 12. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>one Spirit wee are all baptized into one Body, and made to drinke into one Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And hence commeth an ordinarie and vſuall Phraſe in the Scripture, giuing to the Signe the name it ſelfe of the Grace ſignified, as when <note n="h" place="margin">Gen. 17. 10.</note> Circumciſion is called the Couenant; the <note n="i" place="margin">Exod. 12. 11.</note> Lambe, the Paſſeouer, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>To the end they might not bee baſely eſteemed as or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:29324:197"/> and common things, but holily and religiouſly thought of.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward<note place="margin">The Papiſts teach, that the verie worke wrought, is ſufficient to doe away ſinne.</note> Elements being onely Signes &amp; Seales, they ſignifie, not conferre Grace, hauing no inherent force and power to ſanctifie, as ſome kinde of waters haue to cure Diſeaſes. And the Miniſters which deliuer them, giue that which is outward onely. The whole power of ſanctifying, commeth from the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Mat. 3. 11. I baptize you with Water vnto Repentance, but he that commeth after mee, is ſtronger then I; he ſhall bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize you with the Holy Ghoſt and fire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, They are<note place="margin">The Papiſts imagine a neceſſitie of participating the Sacrament of Baptiſme, as if children dying with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Baptiſme, could not bee ſaued; whereas ſuch are aſwell within the Couenant of Grace as thoſe that are baptized.</note> not of ſuch abſolute ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie, as if there could bee no Saluation with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them, ſeeing they are but Signes &amp; Seales of the things alreadie had: and therefore not the want, but the neglect and contempt of the Sacraments, maketh men offenders: which the Lord teacheth vs by his Prophet
<note n="k" place="margin">Ezech. 11. 16</note> 
                  <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> when he promiſeth to be a Sanctuarie to his people, that being led captiue, could not come to the viſible Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arie to worſhip there before him: <hi>Though I haue,</hi> ſayth hee, <hi>driuen them into other Nations, and diſperſed them into diuers Countreyes, yet I</hi> (the Truth of the Sanctuarie, of whom that is but a Sacrament and Figure) <hi>am a Sanctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie vnto them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, Great preparation is required to the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of them, both to vnderſtand what we doe, through a true knowledge of our owne wretchedneſſe, and of the Couenant of Grace in Chriſt, to feele the fruit and the comfort which they bring, and to deſire and affect to be made partakers of it. Great reuerence and atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:29324:197"/> in the receiuing of them, by comparing the Signes and Spirituall things together. Great thankefulneſſe after to God, for his mercies offered vnto vs in them. All which being neceſſarie in the hearing of the Word, is by ſo much the more neceſſarie here, as God by them doth offer a greater grace, and commeth more neere vnto vs: wherefore the
<note n="l" place="margin">1. Co. 11. 28, 29</note> Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Let a man examine him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and ſo eate of this Bread, and drinke of this Cup: for he that eateth and drinketh vnworthily, eateth and drinketh condemnation to himſelfe, not making a difference of the Lords Body.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fiftly, Thoſe that come vnto them; not onely to the Lords Table, but (if they be of riper yeeres) to the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of Baptiſme, are publikely to teſtifie their Faith and Repentance. So we reade, <hi>Mat. 3. 5. Then came forth to him Ieruſalem, and all Iudea, and all the Countrie round about Iorden, and were baptized of him in Iorden, after they had confeſſed their ſinnes.</hi> And <hi>Acts 8. 36, 37. As they went by the way, they came to a certaine water, and the</hi> EV<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NVCH <hi>ſaid, Lo, here is water: what hindereth that I ſhould not bee baptized? And</hi> PHILIP <hi>ſaid, If thou beleeueſt with thy whole heart, thou mayſt. Then hee anſwered, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue that Ieſus Chriſt is that Sonne of God. Then hee bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed him.</hi> And this is the generall rule giuen concerning the Paſſeouer, which was as the Supper of the Lord with vs. <hi>If</hi> 
                  <note n="m" place="margin">Exod. 12. 48.</note> 
                  <hi>any Stranger ſoiourne among you, that would celebrate the Paſſeouer of</hi> IEHOVAH, <hi>let euerie Male of them be circumciſed:</hi> whereby he may teſtifie his conſent in the ſame Faith and Religion with you, <hi>and ſo let him come to celebrate it. None vncircumciſed ſhall eate thereof.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sacraments differ from Sacrifices (beſides other diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences) maynly in nature, for</p>
               <p>Firſt, Sacrifices were giuen, offered, and preſented vnto God: Sacraments are taken and receiued of God, by the hand of the Miniſters of his Word.</p>
               <pb n="366" facs="tcp:29324:198"/>
               <p>Secondly, Sacrifices were Signes and Figures of good things
<note n="n" place="margin">Heb. 10. 1.</note> to come.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Sacraments are Signes and Remembrances of good things alreadie come.</p>
               <p>The next head is a holy Miniſterie, which Chriſt hath<note place="margin">It followeth to ſpeake of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſteries and Graces.

                  <hi>for the perfecting of his Saints, for the building vp of his body:</hi> for this power is deriued from Chriſt, as from the Head and Lord of the Prophets, as we reade, <hi>Mat. 23. 34. Therefore behold, I</hi> (Chriſt

               <p>The difference betweene his Miniſterie and theirs, ſtandeth in theſe two things:</p>
               <p>Firſt, That hee their Head and Lord executed all the parts of his Miniſterie in another ſort, and with greater authoritie and power then any Miniſter before, or after him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 28, 29. and <hi>Marke 1. 22.

               </p>
               <p>Secondly, The Prophets and the Miniſters whom hee ſent, ſpake from him, and in his Name. But hee ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth from himſelfe, and in his owne name, <note n="r" place="margin">

               <p>Preaching therefore is the worke of the Miniſterie, and of thoſe whom God hath lawfully called to execute that publike Function in the Church; for <note n="ſ" place="margin">Rom. 10. 15.</note> 
                  <hi>How can they preach, except they be ſent?</hi> So that the handling of the Word by any other that hath no calling for it, how well ſoeuer hee handle the ſame, and how truely ſoeuer hee expound it, is not that preaching which Chriſt hath ordayned to bring men vnto ſaluation by.</p>
               <p>Not that it is vnlawfull for priuate men to deale with the holy Scriptures, and to open and expound the ſame, ſo euery one keepe him within the bounds and liſts of his Calling, and looke what is fit for him, according to the gifts and graces he hath receiued: but that is of the Maſter in his Family, and within his priuate walls. This which we ſpeake of, is publike in the Congregation and in the Church of God.</p>
               <p>The dutie of Preaching carryeth with it, and hath, as<note place="margin">(which inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the dutie of offering the Churches Prayers)</note> it were, incloſed in the nature and bowels thereof, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther dutie of offering the Churches Prayers, which can neuer be ſeparated from the dutie of Teaching. <hi>Samuel</hi> ioyneth them together, 1. <hi>Sam. 12. 23. Moreouer touching me, God forbid that I ſhould ſinne againſt</hi> IEHOVAH, <hi>in ceaſing to pray for you: yea, I will inſtruct you in the good and right way.</hi> And the whole Colledge of the Apoſtles, <hi>Acts 6. 4. But we will alwayes continue in Prayer, and in miniſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Word.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Publike Prayer is, for the Miniſter to offer vnto God the Prayers and Supplications of the Church; that as in Preaching hee is the Mouth of God vnto his people, ſo in Prayer hee is the <hi>peoples mouth vnto God:</hi> for the Church or Congregation is the place of publike Prayer; and if one liſt to doe it by himſelfe, hee hath his houſe to pray in, but in the Church all are to attend the
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:29324:199"/> Miniſter, which is in CHRISTS place vnto them.</p>
               <p>And that which he, one man doth offer, well appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth to be the Prayers of the Church, by the peoples gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of conſent to that hee prayeth, and ſaying <hi>Amen</hi> vnto it, which appeareth to haue beene the laudable vſe of the old Church, <hi>Nehem. 8. 7. Where</hi> EZRA <hi>bleſſing</hi> IEHOVAH <hi>the great God, all the people anſwered</hi> Amen, Amen, <hi>with lifting vp their hands, and ſtooped, and bowed downe themſelues to</hi> IEHOVAH, <hi>with their faces to the ground-ward.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Primitiue Church in the Apoſtles time did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne the ſame, as appeareth, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 14, 15, 16, 17. in that the Apoſtle by this Argument condemneth thoſe that in the Congregation pray in a ſtrange Language, there being none for to interpret it: <hi>For then,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>how ſhall hee that ſupplyeth the place of an vnlearned man, ſay</hi> Amen, <hi>at thy giuing of thankes, foraſmuch as he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not what thou ſayest?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To the Miniſters alſo belongeth the Adminiſtration of<note place="margin">and Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of the Sacraments.</note> the Sacraments: for in that they haue power to deale with the Word it ſelfe; the diſpenſation of thoſe holy things, which are but Seales and Pledges of the Word, &amp; of the promiſes made in Chriſt, cannot be denied them; the Sacraments being, as it were, a viſible Word; in which reſpect they are ſaid to haue a

               </p>
               <p>The Miniſters of the Word being ſome of them ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarily<note place="margin">Among the Miniſters of the Word, ſome haue bin (extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily) inſpired of Chriſt.</note> rayſed vp of God, other comming in by the ordinary calling of the Church: in thoſe of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſort wee are ſpecially to conſider the Miniſterie of certaine ſelect perſons, inſpired of GOD to deliuer the truth of Chriſtian Doctrine, both by word and writing, which were the Prophets of the Old Teſtament, and the Apoſtles of the New. Whereupon wee are ſaid <hi>to bee</hi>
                  <note n="u" place="margin">Epheſ. 2. 21.</note> 
                  <hi>built vpon the foundation of the Prophets and Apoſtles, Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:29324:199"/> Chriſt himſelfe being the head corner ſtone.</hi> And <hi>Peter</hi>
                  <note n="x" place="margin">2. Pet. 3. 1.</note> ſtirreth vp thoſe to whom hee writes, <hi>to remember the words ſpoken before of the holy Prophets, and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of vs,</hi> ſaith hee, <hi>the Apoſtles of the Lord and Sauiour.</hi> So it is ſaid, <hi>Reuel. 21. 14. The wall of the Citie, new Ieruſalem, had twelue foundations, and vpon them the twelue names of the twelue Apostles of the Lambe.</hi> And in that ſence <hi>Peter</hi> and the reſt may well bee taken to bee that <note n="y" place="margin">Mat. 16. 18.</note> 
                  <hi>Rocke, vpon which Chriſt doth build his Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In this point of the Propheticall and Apoſtolicall Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterie, I obſerue foure things:</p>
               <p>Firſt, That they ſpake, and wrote by Diuine Inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: for <hi>Propheſie</hi> in times paſt, ſaith the Apoſtle, 2. <hi>Pet. 1. 21. came not by the will of man, but as they were mooued by the holy Spirit, did the holy men of God ſpeake.</hi> And <hi>Paul</hi>
                  <note n="z" place="margin">2. Tim. 3. 16.</note> to TIMOTHIE, <hi>All Scripture is inſpired of God, and is profitable to teach, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, The manner how they deliuered this Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine,<note place="margin">to deliuer both by liuely voyce.</note> which was in two ſorts; by liuely voyce, or writing.</p>
               <p>The liuely voyce was euer in the Church, from the beginning, to the death of the Apoſtles: All which time there was almoſt no Age, wherein at the leaſt ſome holy man of God was not extraordinarily ſtirred vp, to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the Doctrine of Truth, from the immediate mouth of God, although there were many times intermiſſions, as the Hiſtorie doth ſhew. And the Church complayneth in the <note n="a" place="margin">Pſal. 74.</note> Pſalmes: yea, this Doctrine was oftentimes corrupted and adulterated, but by new Reuelations re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored againe and kept in the firſt Integritie.</p>
               <p>In limiting the liuely voyce to the time of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, it muſt not ſo bee taken, as if the liuely voyce of the Miniſters of GOD did not continue ſtill in the Church: but that is of Paſtors, and Teachers, who are, and alwayes were to fetch their light from the direction of the Prophets and Apoſtles; it is not of extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:29324:200"/> men inſpired of the Holy Ghoſt, as the Prophets and Apoſtles were.</p>
               <p>The reaſon why a liuely voyce, continuing ſo long as from the beginning of the World, vntill the Apoſtles time, ſhould ceaſe with their death, doth appeare, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 1, 2. where it is ſaid, that <hi>God in many pieces, and after diuers faſhions, of old ſpake to the Fathers by the Prophets: but in theſe latter dayes he hath ſpoken vnto vs by the Sonne.</hi> For ſo long as the Word was deliuered but by parcels, and that there remayned ſomething ſtill behind, more cleerely and manifeſtly to be reuealed (which was till he ſpake fully and laſtly by his Sonne) ſo long a liuely voice was neceſſarie, wherewith euery new Reuelation doth beginne: but longer there can be no vſe of it; for that ſhould plainly argue, that the Reuelation of the Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of Chriſt by Chriſt himſelfe, were not yet perfect.</p>
               <p>By writing they did deliuer it in the Canonicall<note place="margin">and writing</note> Bookes of the Old and New Teſtament, which by way of excellencie wee call the Scriptures, or the written Word; begunne by <hi>Moſes,</hi> and continued during all the time before-mentioned, euen to the death of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles.</p>
               <p>Thoſe Bookes are in the Old Teſtament, <hi>Geneſis, &amp;c.</hi> In the New, <hi>Matthew, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for the Bookes commonly called <hi>Apocrypha,</hi> wee acknowledge therin many profitable things contayned, and good for morall inſtruction; eſpecially in <hi>Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus,</hi> and in the Booke of <hi>Wiſdome,</hi> and ſome things alſo neceſſarie for the vnderſtanding of the Storie of the Church: yet becauſe they carrie not the print of Gods Spirit, which the ſpirituall man diſcerneth, they are not equalled or matched with the Scriptures. And becauſe in many of them, flat vntruths and contrarieties may be found, and in one and the ſame Storie, contradictions with the true Storie penned by the Holy Ghoſt, and in moſt of them diuers things either friuolous and abſurd,
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:29324:200"/> or manifeſtly falſe and forged, or Doctrines taught and commended, which the Word of God condemneth; we cannot without impiety lift them vp into the Chaire of Truth.</p>
               <p>Beſide, They were neither written in the Hebrew, nor receiued of the Iewes,
<note n="b" place="margin">Rom. 3. 2. &amp; 9. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>to whom were committed all the Oracles of God, vnder the Old Teſtament.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But that thoſe which we call Canonicall Scriptures, were inſpired of God, is to be proued by arguments and reaſons taken from the Bookes themſelues.</p>
               <p>As firſt, the Maieſtie of the Word in ſo great ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie, and ſo familiar and plaine a ſtile, ſo piercing and effecting the conſcience, which all the eloquence of the world (and lay it all together) is not poſſibly able to doe, although there lacke not alſo eloquence in the Word, but heauenly and diuine.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The harmony and conſent of ſo many per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, writing at ſeuerall times, in ſeuerall places, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, of ſeuerall arguments and matters, all iumping and concurring in one, as led by one and the ſame Spirit.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The holineſſe of the matter it ſelfe, not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouring of the world, but leading vs by the hand, out and from, aboue the world.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The prediction of future things, many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, yea, thouſand yeeres before they came to paſſe, which all fell out accordingly.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, The ſecret and hidden things there diſcoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, which no wiſdome of the earth, no wit of man was able to reach vnto. Some few ſparkes whereof (ſtollen from hence) haue caſt ſuch a light in the writings of Heathen men, as hath made them to ſeeme diuine.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, The faithfull and ſincere dealing of the Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men whom God hath vſed, that haue not ſpared to lay open their owne nakedneſſe and ſhame, the nakedneſſe and ſhame of their Wiues, Children, Families, &amp; Tribes of whom they came.</p>
               <pb n="372" facs="tcp:29324:201"/>
               <p>Seuenthly, The end and drift of all, which is, to giue glorie vnto God, and to beat downe and abaſe the pride of man.</p>
               <p>A ſecond ſort of argument, is from the authoritie of the Church, which may moue and well perſwade vs of them.</p>
               <p>The third and laſt (without which, all the reſt, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther humane teſtimonies, or other arguments, are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing) is the teſtimony of the Spirit it ſelfe, bearing wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of them, <hi>Eſay 59. 21. My Spirit that is in thee, and my Word that I haue put in thy mouth.</hi> Therefore, <hi>Eſay</hi> 54. 13. the faithfull are ſaid to be ſuch as are <hi>taught of God.</hi> And PAVL ſaith, <hi>The ſpirituall man diſcerneth all things, 1. Cor.</hi> 2. 15.</p>
               <p>Therefore it is not the iudgement of the Church, which maketh vs beleeue the Scriptures: but the Church is the ſame to the teſtimony of the Spirit, that the <note n="c" place="margin">Ioh. 4. 39, 40, 41, 42.</note> wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of Samaria was to the preaching of our Sauiour Chriſt; becauſe of whoſe words, many of the Samari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans were brought to beleeue in Chriſt: but when hee himſelfe came and preached amongſt them, they tell her plainely, <hi>Now wee beleeue no more, becauſe of thy ſpeech: for wee our ſelues haue heard, and know, that this is of a truth, That Sauiour of the World, That Chriſt.</hi> So the iudgement of the Church may well bee a motiue at the firſt, and alſo bring great ſtay and confirmation to a mind that is once inlightned, but the maine ſtrength of all dependeth vpon the teſtimonie of the Spirit.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, In the miniſtery of the Prophets &amp; Apoſtles,<note place="margin">(ſo as they could not erre)</note> I obſerue the qualitie of their doctrine, thus deliuered by diuine inſpiration.</p>
               <p>Firſt, It was not ſubiect to error; for howſoeuer they were men ſubiect to ſinfull infirmitie, and in part onely regenerate, whoſe ſeruice it pleaſed God to vſe for this purpoſe; yet in the deliuery of the Doctrine, they were ſo extraordinarily gouerned and inſpired with his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:29324:201"/> that they <note n="d" place="margin">Ioh. 16. 13.</note> could by no meanes erre.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It is holy, both the whole and euery part, whereupon grow theſe ſpeeches,
<note n="e" place="margin">2. Pet. 1. 21.</note> 
                  <hi>The holy men of God,</hi>
                  <note n="f" place="margin">2. Pet. 3. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>The holy Prophets,</hi> 
                  <note n="g" place="margin">Eph. 3. 5. Reu. 18. 20.</note> 
                  <hi>The holy Apoſtles,</hi> 
                  <note n="h" place="margin">2. Pet. 2. 22.</note> 
                  <hi>The holy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements,</hi> 
                  <note n="i" place="margin">Rom. 1. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>The holy Scriptures:</hi> whereas all other bookes and ſpeeches of men are prophane, further then they fetch ſome holineſſe from hence.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, That both their Sermons, and theſe Bookes written by the Spirit of Chriſt, are of ſoueraigne autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie in the Church of God, and haue the ſole pre-emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence for the deciding of all controuerſies, the iudging and diſcerning of all ſayings, and writings of men: for vnto them the holy Ghoſt doth alwaies call vs, <note n="k" place="margin">Eſay 8. 20.</note> 
                  <hi>To the Law and to the teſtimonie, if they ſpeake not according to this Word, it is, becauſe there is no light in them.</hi> And this is it which Chriſt vſed as the weapon to foile Satan, <hi>Math.</hi> 4. So the Apoſtle <hi>Paul, 1. Corin.</hi> 15. 3, 4. maketh the Scriptures to giue credit to his doctrine, <hi>I haue deliuered vnto you, that which I haue receyued; that Chriſt dyed for our ſins, according to the Scriptures, and that he was buried, and that he was rayſed the third day, according to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, &amp;c.</hi> The men likewiſe of Berhea, <hi>Acts</hi> 17. 11. are commended for examining by the Scriptures the things which <hi>Paul</hi> taught. Therefore our Sauiour <note n="l" place="margin">Iohn 5. 39.</note> Chriſt referreth vs to the Scriptures, as to the Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone of all truth, <hi>Search the Scriptures;</hi> and in <note n="m" place="margin">Matth. 22. 25</note> another place, <hi>Yee erre, not knowing the Scriptures:</hi> For the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of theſe Bookes is greater than the authoritie of the Church, as the authoritie of God, who cannot erre, muſt needes be greater than the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity<note place="margin">The Popiſh Doctrine, which hangeth the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, vpon the Church.</note> of men, that may and doe erre. Againe, the Church hath her life and being from the Word, inaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as faith, which maketh a Church, cannot bee without the Word: So hath not the Word from the Church.</p>
               <pb n="374" facs="tcp:29324:202"/>
               <p>Thirdly, It is aboue the authoritie of the Angels of heauen,
<note n="n" place="margin">Gal. 1. 8, 9.</note> who, if they preach any other doctrine, are to be held accurſed: How much more, aboue the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the Church?</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Our Sauiour Chriſt attributeth this excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie to his Word, which men or Angels cannot chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge, that <hi>in the latter Day, it is That which ſhall iudge him that doth not receiue it, Iohn</hi> 12. 48.</p>
               <p>But why then is the Church called <hi>the Pillar of Truth, 1. Tim.</hi> 3. 15? Surely, becauſe the Truth of God dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth no where elſe; and there is alwaies Truth ſufficient to ſaluation; Not that the Church eyther beareth and bringeth forth the Truth of God, or is the chiefe and fundamentall ground to hold it vp: for ſhe her ſelfe hath another foundation to ſticke vnto, from whence ſhee fetcheth all her Truth, which is the doctrine of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and Apoſtles,
<note n="o" place="margin">Eph. 2. 20. 1. Cor. 3. 11. Eſay 28. 16.</note> Chriſt himſelfe beeing the head Corner-ſtone; and is not the Mother, but the Nurſe of the Truth of God, that cheriſheth and preſerueth the ſame, and giueth teſtimonie thereof vnto the World.</p>
               <p>To the true meaning of the Scriptures, we are to reach by the Scriptures themſelues, the ſame Spirit that indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them, ſuggeſting and opening the ſence vnto vs. So did the Leuites (that taught the people, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 8. 9.) <hi>render the ſenſe, and giue the vnderſtanding of it by the Scripture it ſelfe.</hi> Our Sauiour alſo, <hi>Matth.</hi> 4. beeing ſet vpon by Satan, that clipped and wreſted the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, to ſerue his owne turne, confuted his falſe gloſſes and expoſitions of it, by the conference of other Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
               <p>The meanes we muſt vſe for this purpoſe, are theſe: Firſt, we muſt come with a mind to profit, and to bee made the better by them, not to read them for know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge onely, or vaine oſtentation, much leſſe to cauill at them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Prayer is to bee vſed to God, to open and
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:29324:202"/> enlighten our hearts, that wee may ſee the wonderfull things that lye hid therein.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, We are to frequent the Houſe of God, and to giue diligent attendance vpon the Miniſtery and Preaching of the Word, whereby the Doctrines deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the Scriptures, are beaten out and made famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar, and plaine vnto vs: the ſame being alſo the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie meanes, by which the holy Ghoſt doth vſe to worke in our hearts all true and ſpirituall wiſdome.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, the true ſenſe and nature of the words, euery one apart, and the conſtruction of them all together, muſt be waighed.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, We muſt alwaies take the proper and naturall ſenſe, if the matter it ſelfe will beare it.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, The ſumme of the matter, the ſcope and drift of the place, the Arguments and their coherence, the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, and the order of the Text muſt be reſpected.</p>
               <p>Seuenthly, We muſt conferre it with other places of the Scriptures, the darke and obſcure ones, with thoſe that are more lightſome.</p>
               <p>Eighthly, We muſt alwaies hold the analogie or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of faith, neuer framing any expoſition to our ſelues, that altereth or declineth from that.</p>
               <p>The fourth and laſt qualitie is, that in euerie age the<note place="margin">the whole Truth of Chriſt</note> whole Truth of God was deliuered by a liuely voyce, as touching the ſubſtance of the Doctrine, although in greater cleereneſſe, vpon the comming of Chriſt, then euer it was before, and laſtly and perfectly (wherein we are now to reſt, both for their ſubſtance &amp; manner of reuelation) it is fully and abſolutely comprehended in the Scriptures: So as we ſhall not need to flye eyther to Viſions, and Reuela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,<note place="margin">Anabaptiſts &amp; Libertines, that bring in Viſions and Reuelations, as if the Word of God were imperfect.</note> or to mens Traditions and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentions,<note place="margin">Papiſts, that ſupply it by mens Traditions, and Inuentions, Vnwritten Verities, Sentences of Fathers, Canons of Councels, &amp;c.</note>
                  <pb n="376" facs="tcp:29324:203"/> to Vnwritten Verities, Sentences of Fathers, Canons of Councels, &amp;c. for to helpe vs: but all is to be had in the written Word: for when our Sauiour ſaith,
<note n="p" place="margin">Iohn 5. 39.</note>

                     <p>Secondly, They vſe their Miracles (ſuch as they bee) to a wrong end, for ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uancing of erronious and lying doctrines, and to ſhake the truth of the Goſpell, for confirmation whereof all Miracles ought to ſerue.

               </p>
               <p>To come to the fourth point: therein I obſerue the great difference that is betweene this Grace and Faith, both in the nature of the things, and in the fruites and effects that come from them, how like ſoeuer in ſhew they ſeeme to be.</p>
               <p>In nature they differ two manner of wayes:</p>
               <p>Firſt, Here is but a taſte onely, not an apprehenſion and laying hold of Chriſt, to make him ones owne, like vnto a Cooke that taſteth of the meate, and ſpitteth it out againe, or as he that waſheth his mouth with water, but letteth it not goe downe his throte: hereupon it is,
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:29324:206"/> that they are ſaid to <note n="q" place="margin">Mat. 13. 21.</note> want a
<note n="r" place="margin">Col. 2. 7.</note> roote which the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full haue.</p>
               <p>From whence I gather, that their faith is but a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall and confuſed faith, whereby they are perſwaded, that God will beſtow many great and glorious things vpon thoſe that are in Chriſt, but neuer wreſtle with their owne ſoules, to apply and appropriate the ſame vnto themſelues; they know not what it meaneth to haue Chriſts Righteouſneſſe theirs, or their ſinnes to be layed vpon him: they feele no teſtimonie of reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to God, no aſſurance that all things are for good vnto them, no peace of conſcience, no hope of eternall life, the excellencie whereof they are rauiſhed withall, and admire to behold in others, as <hi>Balaam</hi> the falſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet did, but finde in themſelues no comfort of it, no more then a man doth of the Sunne, when it ſhineth not in his owne Horizon.</p>
               <p>The ſecond difference betweene the nature of faith and it, is, that this taſte (whatſoeuer the ſame be) is not of Chriſt himſelfe, whoſe <note n="ſ" place="margin">Mat. 9. 21. 22</note> leaſt touch hath a ſauing vertue ioyned with it, but of <hi>ſome ſweetneſſe</hi> that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth from him; no more then the Cooke that licketh his fingers, can bee ſaid to eate of the meate prepared for his Maſters Table: So as their eſtate may bee likened vnto thoſe, who comming out of a cloſe Dungeon, where, in all their life, they neuer ſaw the Sunne, aſſoone as they come into a more open place, vpon the firſt ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting of the beames, are rauiſhed with the excellencie of the Sunne, though yet they ſee not the Sunne it ſelfe: for the Reprobate onely ſee a glimmering of the light of the Sunne, at the dawning of the day, before it ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth; whereas the Elect haue <hi>the</hi>

               <p>Touching the fruits and effects; the thorow change wrought in Gods Children, differeth from this kinde of change, which falleth vpon the Reprobate many wayes.</p>
               <p>Firſt, In the things themſelues; for their reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is not a whole and ſound conuerſion vnto God, but amending ſome one or few faults, they hold ſome other ſtill, which they can neuer be brought to leaue. As <note n="y" place="margin">Marke 6. 20.</note> 
                  <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod,</hi> who did many things, and yet would not part from his Brothers Wife: whereas the godly doe not ſome things, but all they are commanded.</p>
               <p>Secondly, In the manner; for their affections are but<note place="margin">yet ſo, as it may be loſt againe:</note> vaniſhing, and flitting motions, that ſuddenly goe out, like vnto a blaze of fire, or elſe for want of cheriſhing by Prayer, hearing of the Word, and other holy meanes, as it were of putting Oyle in their Lampes, in time it commeth to be quencht, or elſe when they are touched to the quicke, that they ſee the following of CHRIST, cannot ſtand with the ſatisfying of their owne delights or other matters which they are reſolued to keepe; they chooſe rather to loſe him, then to forſake themſelues, and ſo for pleaſure, profit or feare of men, they vomit vp all againe.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, In the end; for both they deſire to bee ſaued, not to glorifie God, but onely becauſe they are afraid of Hell, as may bee ſeene in <hi>Balaam:</hi> and they confeſſe their faults, and leaue and forſake ſinne, not becauſe they hate and diſlike it, but for feare of iudgement; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the godly are ſorrie and grieued in heart, becauſe they offend a louing and moſt gracious Father.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, In the meanes; for lacking ſaith, it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:29324:207"/> that they ſhould euer come in true Repentance vnto God, or aske pardon of their ſinnes, and ſo to bee made partakers of the promiſe, <note n="z" place="margin">Mat. 7. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>Aske and it ſhall bee giuen vnto you: Seeke and you ſhall finde: Knocke and it ſhall be opened vnto you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now followeth the ſinne moſt oppoſite to this Grace,<note place="margin">But whoſo once of malice falleth from it (which we call Sinne againſt the Holy Ghoſt)</note> which we call ſinne againſt the Holy Ghoſt: when a man falleth of malice from this Grace once receiued.</p>
               <p>To explayne this more fully:</p>
               <p>Firſt, It is an act done, and a ſinne which may bee diſcerned and knowne; elſe the Apoſtle <note n="a" place="margin">1 Iohn 5. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>Iohn</hi> would not forbid vs to pray for ſuch perſons: no, <hi>Paul</hi> 
                  <note n="b" place="margin">1. Cor. 16. 22.</note> wils vs to execute the curſe of the Church vpon them; it is not a continuall going forward in ſinne without Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It is no legall ſinne (if I may ſo ſay) againſt the duties (properly) either of the firſt or ſecond Table, but Euangelicall, directly againſt Chriſt in the point of his Mediation, <note n="c" place="margin">Heb. 10. 29.</note> accounting his bloud but as common bloud, and of no more power to ſanctifie, then the bloud of another man: Therefore no ſinne againſt good manners, as Murder, Adulterie, and the reſt, or though it be immediatly bent againſt God himſelfe, and the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the firſt Table, can bee drawne within that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe; as Idolatry, Witchcraft, Coniuring and the like, though they ſhould hap to be committed of ſuch as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe the Goſpell.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, It is of thoſe that haue receiued the <note n="e" place="margin">2. Pet. 2. 20.</note> know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Truth: So as all Reprobates come not to this high pitch of ſinne, nor any that ſinne of ignorance: therefore <note n="f" place="margin">1. Tim. 1. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>Pauls</hi> blaſphemie was a ſinne that might be pardoned, in as much as he did it ignorantly. And our Sauiour <note n="g" place="margin">Luke 23. 34.</note> vſeth this reaſon for the Iewes that put him to death: <hi>Father, forgiue them; for they know not what they doe.</hi> So the Apoſtle PETER ſaith, <hi>Acts 3. 17. And now, Brethren, I know that yee haue done this
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:29324:207"/> ignorantly, as alſo your Rulers.</hi> Meaning the multitude and generall number of them, which were <note n="h" place="margin">1. Cor. 2. 8.</note> not able to diſcerne of the Godhead of Chriſt, lying hid vnder the vaile of his fleſh, not of euery one in particular; for ſome wittingly and willingly, and contrarie to their owne conſcience, went againſt him, knowing what hee <note n="i" place="margin">Iohn 7. 28.</note> was, and wher<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e he came; which gaue our Sauiour oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to handle this Argument, <hi>Matthew 12. Marke 3. Luke</hi> 12.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, It is a ſinne not ſimply againſt knowledge, but againſt the light of the Spirit, or that ſweetneſſe and comfort which once they felt in Chriſt: And ſo it appeareth, that many of the Iewes offended, of whom our <note n="k" place="margin">Iohn 5. 36.</note> Sauiour ſaith, that they did with cheerfulneſſe reioyce for a time in the Miniſterie of <hi>Iohn Baptiſt,</hi> prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching Chriſt vnto them; and yet afterwards <note n="l" place="margin">Iohn 5. 38.</note> fell backe and had no <note n="m" place="margin">Iohn 5. 40.</note> liſt to come vnto Chriſt. This inlighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is <note n="n" place="margin">Mat. 12. 43. 2. Pet. 2. 20, 23. Heb. 6. 5. &amp; 10. 29.</note> a diuine and ſupernaturall worke of GODS Spirit changing a mans corruption, and entring him into the high-way that leadeth to Regeneration: So that I cannot thinke that either the ſinne of Angels, if you conſider their firſt fall (though then they were moſt glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Creatures, and Children of Light, and their fall preſumptuous) or yet their ſinne, being now become Deuils, (though they <note n="o" place="margin">Mat. 8. 29.</note> know Chriſt to bee the true <hi>Meſſias,</hi> the Son and the Holy One of God, and he of whom they muſt bee iudged, and yet with all their might and mayne oppugne him) can bee ſaid (properly) the ſinne againſt the Holy Ghoſt, in that ſence which the Scripture ſpeaketh of it; though I denie not, but it is at the leaſt, equiualent, or rather much beyond it: for both at the firſt they ſinned againſt that naturall light onely, that they had by their firſt Creation, which alſo was immediatly bent againſt the Maieſtie of God, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the reſpect of a Redeemer, and ſince that time, they are not vouchſafed grace to haue any taſte at all of the
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:29324:208"/> ſweetneſſe in CHRIST, nor poſſibly can haue, ſeeing he
<note n="p" place="margin">Heb. 2. 16.</note> came not for a Sauiour vnto them.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, It is a witting and <note n="q" place="margin">
                     <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 2. 6. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> voluntarie ſin, freely, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out compulſion, or other, not cauſe onely, but colour or ſhew of cauſe.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, It is of meere malice againſt that which their owne conſcience telleth them to be ſo good, and againſt Chriſt, the Authour of it, <note n="r" place="margin">Heb. 6. 6.</note> crucifying him in their hearts, and making a mocke of him: becauſe, if they will be his, they ſee they cannot enioy thoſe Pleaſures, Profits or Preferments which they dote vpon, and are reſolued to hold, though they loſe their owne ſoules for it; whereof commeth a perſecuting and blaſpheming of things they haue beleeued, and of all that doe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe the ſame, an vtter <note n="ſ" place="margin">Heb. 6. 6. &amp; 10. 29.</note> reuolt from Chriſt, and open warre againſt him. It ſeemeth, the Holy Ghoſt noteth this ſinne, to haue beene in <hi>Saul, 1. Sam. 22. 17. Kill the Prieſts of</hi> IEHOVA. He ſaith not ſimply, <hi>Kill the Prieſts:</hi> but <hi>the Priests of</hi> IEHOVAH: as if hee ſhould haue ſaid, I? Hath Chriſt indeed ſerued me ſo, not onely to turne me out of my Kingdome, and to giue it to my ſeruant; but will he now, by his anſweres and Oracles, teach him how to riſe vp and lye in waite againſt mee? Well, though my malice cannot reach to him who is in Heauen, yet I will wracke it vpon his Darlings the Prieſts: <hi>Goe, kill me all his Prieſts, &amp;c.</hi> It is not a falling of frailtie and infirmitie, though wittingly as that of <hi>Peters</hi> was. By all which may appeare, that this being a hidden and a ſecret ſinne lurking in the heart, is moſt hard to bee diſcerned, ſaue when it pleaſeth God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, as it were, from Heauen to reueale it: which in the time of the Apoſtles, to whom the extraordinarie Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of his Spirit were more plenteous, hee did now and then, as appeareth in thoſe that ſeduced the <hi>Galatians,</hi> and further, by that alleaged out of <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, but in the ſucceeding Ages more rarely, whereof
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:29324:208"/> notwithſtanding <hi>Iulian</hi> the <hi>Apostata</hi> may bee an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, againſt whom the Prayers of the Church were ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to cut him off.</p>
               <p>Seuenthly, It is an vtter reuolt, not from Chriſt, or any good thing wee haue in him, vpon which Rocke, whoſoeuer is firmely built, the gates of Hell cannot preuaile againſt him, though they may ſorely ſhake him; but from a loue and <note n="t" place="margin">Mat. 13. 20, 21</note> ioy in ſome ſweet thing which yet neuer had roote in their heart. Therefore they that once beleeue in Chriſt, and by faith are rooted in him, can neuer come within the compaſſe of this ſinne.</p>
               <p>With this ſinne againſt the Holy Ghoſt, a <note n="u" place="margin">Heb. 6. 6.</note> finall<note place="margin">can neuer bee repayred.</note> vnrepentance is vnſeparably ioyned; ſo that they which commit it, can neuer come to Faith and Repentance, nor euer be in Chriſt, which maketh it <note n="x" place="margin">Mat. 12. 32.</note> vnpardonable.</p>

That vnder the Old Teſtament had diuers Rites, Ceremonies and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices: Figures of Chriſt, and of the good things we haue in him. Eſpecially a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Iewes, his then peculiar people, whereby the diſpenſation of thoſe times was more obſcure, and leſſe accompanied with Knowledge and other Graces. But of all theſe things, as alſo of their Sacraments (which in regard of the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Signes were a part of the Legall Paedagogie) and likewiſe of the Miniſteries that were among them, both that of Prophets (inſpired, by whom were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the Bookes of the Old Teſtament) and of other, I haue written at large in a Treatiſe entituled, <hi>The Old Teſtament, or The Promiſe.</hi> To the Church of the New Teſtament, the diſpenſation is in all cleerneſſe and perfection.</note> But according to the difference of times, it is to bee diſtinguiſhed into the Church vnder the Law (I meane the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remoniall Law, whileſt the promiſe was afoot) and the Church in the time of the
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:29324:209"/> Goſpell; differing onely by the diuerſitie of diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation before and ſince his comming.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>God,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle to the <hi>Hebrewes, in many pieces,</hi>

                  </note> 
                  <hi>and after diuers faſhions, of old ſpake to the Fathers by the Prophets, but in theſe latter dayes he hath ſpoken vnto vs by his Sonne.</hi> The manner therefore and the meaſure of the Reuelation of Chriſt did differ:</p>
               <p>Firſt, For the manner, it was vnto them in diuers Rites, Ceremonies, Types and Figures, and therefore darke and obſcure; To vs all things are plainly without any ſhaddowes, the bodie being come, which is Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Though the ſubſtance of the doctrine it ſelfe was alwayes full and perfect, yet as touching the meaſure and cleerneſſe of Reuelation, there was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſtill behind more fully to bee manifeſted, till hee ſpake laſtly, and perfectly by his Sonne vpon his owne comming in the fleſh. And this the ſilly woman of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maria may teach vs, to haue beene a doctrine which euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more ſounded in the Church; <note n="z" place="margin">Iohn 4. 25.</note>

Whatſoeuer I haue heard from my Father, I haue made knowne vnto you.</hi> And <hi>Iohn 8. 26. The things which I haue heard from him, (that ſent me) thoſe doe I ſpeake in the World.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Vpon theſe two differences it muſt follow, that whileſt the Church was in her infancie, vnder the Rudiments of the Law, the Fathers ſeeing by that darke and dimme light, neither could their knowledge be ſo perfect, nor were the Graces dealt vnto them ſo plentifull, and ſo many. The Euangeliſt teacheth it excellently, <hi>Iohn</hi> 1. 14, 15, 16, 17. comparing the Miniſterie of <hi>Moſes</hi> which ſtood in Rites and Ordinances, with Chriſt and his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie. The <note n="a" place="margin">Verſe 14.</note> Diuine Maieſtie, ſaith he, that ſhone in Chriſt, the Reſplendence of his Fathers Glorie, euen as wee conſider him clothed in our fleſh, was conſpicuous
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:29324:209"/> to the World in two eminent Vertues, <hi>Grace and Truth,</hi> which hee had, not in meaſure, nor by participation, but the whole nature and fulneſſe of them.
<note n="b" place="margin">Verſe 15.</note> Whereunto <hi>Iohn Baptiſt</hi> himſelfe bare record, highly magnifying the Perſon and Office of Chriſt aboue his owne: Who, though he were in the number of his Auditours, and did follow him, (as Schollers vſe to come behind their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter) yet had the precedence, and was infinitely preferred before him; for ſo his worth and excellencie, farre be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond <hi>Iohns,</hi> did require. But both theſe vertues, really reſiding in himſelfe, he hath beene pleaſed to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate vnto vs in large and aboundant manner: firſt, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching Grace: <note n="c" place="margin">Verſe 16.</note> From, the fulneſſe of Chriſt anointed with the ſubſtance of it, wee receiue <hi>grace for grace:</hi> the ſame very grace, &amp; all the graces that are in him, though not in the ſame meaſure, as the Waxe doth the print of the Seale, print for print: and the childe the fathers li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neaments, limme for limme. <note n="d" place="margin">Verſe 17.</note> Whereas the Law (the Ceremoniall Law) deliuered by <hi>Moſes,</hi> hauing but a ſhaddow of good things to come, was not able to ſet a liuely print, and to ſtampe grace vpon them, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 1.</p>
               <p>Secondly, For Truth: <note n="e" place="margin">Verſe 18.</note> He, onely Hee, one with his Father, and of the ſame nature and eſſence, hath euiden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced him, and made him viſible, who before was hidden vnder the ſhaddowes and Ceremonies of the Law. The Apoſtle to the <hi>Corinths,</hi> handling the ſame Argument, hath in effect the ſame Metaphore, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 13, 14, 18. In the Old Teſtament, a vayle or couering kept away the cleer Light, that their eyes were rather dazeled, then able to looke into the bottome of <hi>Moſes</hi> Miniſtery. But now, in theſe times of the Goſpell, wherein wee behold the Glorie of the Lord, in his Sonne manifeſted in the fleſh, as in a Glaſſe or Mirrour, the beames of his Glorie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting, leaue an Image or print behind them, to make vs alſo glorious by a ſecondarie kind of Glorie. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto it maketh, that the ſtate of the Church vnder the

Not ſhaddowes or figures of heauenly things to come, but themſelues the true heauenly things, which thoſe vnder the Law were Types and Samplers of.</p>
               <p>This bountie of Chriſt, to fill all things with the rich Graces of his Spirit, the Scripture maketh an effect of his Glorification, or ſitting at the right hand of GOD, <hi>Epheſ. 4. 7, 8.

               <p>But of the whole diſpenſation of God towards the Fathers, full of ſo great varietie of matter, becauſe it would aske a Volume, and is too large for this place and our purpoſe, you haue a treatiſe by it ſelfe, entituled, <hi>The Old Teſtament, or, The Promiſe:</hi> Let vs now come to the Sacraments of the New Teſtament, and the ſeuerall ſorts of Miniſteries.</p>
               <p>There be two Sacraments of the new Teſtament, Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme,<note place="margin">Touching the Sacraments and Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the new Teſtament: There be two Sacraments, Baptiſme and the Lords Supper. Baptiſme is a waſhing with water,</note> and the Lords Supper, as the Apoſtle reckoneth them, 1. <hi>Cor. 10. 1. Cor.</hi> 12, 13, 14.</p>
               <p>Baptiſme is a waſhing with water, to aſſure our incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porating into Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Where the outward ſigne is double: firſt, The Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or matter is Water, and not any other Liquor, <hi>Matth. 3. 11. I baptize you with Water vnto Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, The action and forme of Baptiſme, as the Miniſters waſhing of the baptized perſon, which in the Eaſt &amp; hote countries was wont to be by the dipping &amp; diuing, as it were, of all the bodie into the water; whence Baptiſme hath his name: with vs, it is by ſprinkling;<note place="margin">to aſſure our entrance into the Couenant</note> for that young childrens bodies are not able to beare the other. And here a three-fold Ceremonie is to bee ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued.</p>
               <p>Firſt, The ſprinkling: ſecondly, The lying, as it were, vnder the water: thirdly, The riſing out of it: all which, the Apoſtle noteth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 3, 4.</p>
               <p>The grace ſignified, is our incorporating into Chriſt: And therefore it is called,
<note n="i" place="margin">Tit. 3. 5. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his mercie he hath ſaued vs by the Lauer of Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration.</note> 
                  <hi>The Lauer</hi> or Sacrament <hi>of Regeneration:</hi> and thereupon wee are ſaid in Baptiſme, <note n="k" place="margin">Gal. 3. 27. As many of you as are baptized into Chriſt, haue put on Chriſt.</note>

               <p>Firſt, That it is the firſt Sacrament of the Church, as birth is the firſt beginning of our life.</p>

                     <p>The Nouatians denie forgiueneſſe of ſinnes to them that fell after Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme.</p>
                  </note> but once only, as men are borne but once; yet it aſſureth vs of our vnion with Chriſt, not once, but all the dayes of our life, and teſtifieth the forgiueneſſe of all ſinnes, paſt, preſent, or to come: And therefore is ſaid to ſaue vs, 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 2.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Hereupon wee are ſaid to be baptized <hi>into the name of the</hi>

               <p>Fiftly, It is a Sacrament alſo of our vniting into the Church. Therefore
<note n="n" place="margin">Gal. 3. 27.</note> 
                  <hi>Paul,</hi> after he had ſaid, <hi>As many of you as are baptized into Chriſt, haue put on Chriſt,</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately addeth, <hi>For all you are one in Christ Ieſus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sixtly, Being a ſeale of Regeneration, conſequently it ſealeth vp the fruits thereof.</p>
               <p>Iuſtification and Sanctification: <hi>Hee hath ſaued vs,</hi> ſaith
<note n="o" place="margin">Tit. 3. 5, 6, 7.</note> PAVL, <hi>by the Lauer of Regeneration, and of the renewing of the holy Spirit, which hee hath ſhed forth vpon vs richly, through Ieſus Chriſt our Sauiour; That beeing iuſtified by his grace, wee might be made heires in hope of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlaſting life.</hi>

               <pb n="393" facs="tcp:29324:211"/>
               <p>A ſeale it is of Iuſtification in this ſort: firſt, Of the hiding and couering of ſinnes, by the couering of the childes face with water.</p>
               <p>Secondly, of Chriſts accompliſhment of the Law, making vs righteous, by the water waſhing and making cleane the Bodie.</p>
               <p>It is a ſeale of Sanctification thus:</p>

               <p>Secondly, As after the water ſhed from the Bodie, the Bodie appeareth white and cleane: ſo doe wee riſe and appeare in newneſſe of life; and hereof it is called a

               <p>All theſe vſes, both for Iuſtification and Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the diſtinct parts of euery one, the Apoſtle no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably ſetteth forth, <hi>Rom. 6. 3, 4, 5, 6.

               </p>
               <p>The Lords Supper is a receyuing of Bread and Wine, to aſſure our growing vp in Chriſt, where the outward ſigne is double, as before in Baptiſme.<note place="margin">The Lords Supper is a feeding with Bread, and Wine,</note>
               </p>

               <p>Secondly, The action, which is the Miniſters break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of bread, and powring forth<note place="margin">The Superſtition of the Papiſts, which will haue it thruſt into their mouthes.</note> of wine, with his deliuering of them both, and the peoples re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyuing of them, <hi>Matth. 26. 26, 27.

               <p>The Miniſters deliuering of Bread &amp; Wine, ſignifieth Gods giuing of Chriſt to all beleeuers: our taking of Bread and Wine, the apprehending of Chriſt by faith, and applying him to our ſelues. <hi>Matth. 26. 26, 27, 28.

               <p>Firſt, it were elſe no Sacrament, if there be no ſigne left of a thing ſignified.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It ouerthroweth the truth of CHRISTS humane nature, to make it in many places at once, to bee inuiſible, without colour or accidents. All which muſt bee admitted, if CHRISTS very fleſh be there.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, It is contrarie to the expreſſe authoritie of the SCRIPTVRE, which ſaith,
<note n="u" place="margin">Acts 3. 21.</note> 
                  <hi>Heauen muſt contayne him, till the time of the reſtoring of all things.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, If the bread be Chriſt, then in the firſt Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution there were two Chriſts; one, that gaue the bread (for that Chriſt himſelfe did:) another that was giuen. And as he which is Truth it ſelfe, ſaith, <hi>This is my body:</hi> So he <note n="x" place="margin">Luke 22. 10.</note> ſaith, that <hi>the Cup is the New Teſtament,</hi> which muſt needs be vnderſtood figuratiuely for the Wine, to bee a ſeale of the New Teſtament: as Baptiſme is called, <hi>The new</hi>

                  <hi>of ſinnes.</hi> And the like is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly to bee ſeene in the Old Teſtament, as wee heard before of Circumciſion, and the Paſchall Lambe, which gaue occaſion to our Sauiour Chriſt, ſpeaking by the ſame Spirit, to vſe the ſame courſe of figuratiue and borrowed ſpeeches, being oftentimes more lightſome then the other, and better fitting the nature of a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and that neere coniunction which is betweene the ſigne &amp; the thing ſignified, Chriſt himſelfe being indeed and truely giuen in the Sacrament, but ſpiritually by Faith, not in a carnall or fleſhly manner.</p>
               <p>The forme which the Miniſter is here to vſe, is in deliuery of the Bread:
<note n="a" place="margin">1. Cor. 11. 24.</note> 
                  <hi>Take yee, eat yee: This is my Bodie which is giuen for you: Doe this in remembrance of mee.</hi> In deliuerie of the Cup,

               </p>
               <pb n="397" facs="tcp:29324:213"/>
               <p>Theſe are the<note place="margin">The Papiſts dreame of fiue other Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Matrimonie, Orders, Penance, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation, and Extreme Vnction; whereof Confirmation and Extreme Vnction are vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly their owne inuentions without any warrant of the Word. The other three haue foundation in the Word, but not for any Sacraments: for touching Matrimonie and Penance, neither of them are Ceremonies, but Matrimonie a morall dutie, &amp; Penance, (as they call it) the grace it ſelfe promiſed in the Goſpell. In Orders or Impoſition of hands, there is indeed a Ceremonie, but neither common to the whole Church, nor inſtituted for the aſſurance of our Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation with God in Chriſt, which is the end and the nature of all Sacraments. The reaſon of the Papiſts to make Matrimonie a Sacrament, (for that the Apoſtle, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5. 32. ſaith, <hi>This is a great Myſterie:</hi> which the old Interpreter tranſlateth, <hi>This is a great Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>) is ridiculous: for Firſt, <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Mysterie</hi> onely. And if as oft not onely as the word <hi>Myſterie</hi> is vſed, but as the old Interpreter tranſlateth the ſame (<hi>Sacrament</hi>) wee ſhould forthwith haue a new Sacrament, there would be no end of Sacraments. Then the calling of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles muſt bee a Sacrament; then the Will of God muſt be a Sacrament, and many moe: for ſo the old Interpreter tranſlateth this word, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. 9. and 3. 9. and <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 1. 27. Secondly, <hi>Paul</hi> in that place to the <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians</hi> doth plainly expound himſelfe, vnder the name of <hi>Myſterie,</hi> to comprehend not the coniunction of man and wife; but the ſpirituall Coniunction which is betweene Chriſt and his Church. To ſpeake nothing, how fond is it to make that a Sacrament, which is the Ordinance of God, not for his Church onely, but for thoſe which are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, and which they themſelues by their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine barre their holy Shauelings from?</note> two Sacraments, and all the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that are of perpetuall vſe in the Church of GOD, for the ſtrengthening of our Faith:</p>
               <p>For firſt, theſe are onely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, <hi>Mat. 28. 19. Go, baptize all Nations. Mat. 26. 27, 28. Take, eate, &amp;c. Drinke ye all of this.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, By them, all the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are perfectly aſſured, and ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led vp vnto vs. In <hi>Baptiſme, our first entrance</hi> and ingraffing into Chriſt. In the <hi>Supper,</hi> our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce &amp; grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vp in him. And that is it that the Apoſtle mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, when hee ſaith, that by thoſe two wee partake of whole Chriſt his Bodie and Spirit, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:29324:214"/> 13, 14. <hi>By one Spirit we haue all beene baptized into one Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die</hi> (there is our incorporating) <hi>and beene all made to drinke into one Spirit,</hi> that quickeneth and keepeth life within vs (there is the increaſe and growing vp in Chriſt.)</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The ſame Sacraments haue beene in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance to all Gods people, from the beginning of the World, and neuer any more. 1. <hi>Cor. 10. 1, 2, 3, 4. Now I would not haue you ignorant, Brethren, that all our Fathers were vnder the Cloud, and all paſſed thorow the Sea, and all were baptized, comming vnto</hi> MOSES, <hi>with the Cloud, and with the Sea: And all did eat the ſame Spirituall meat, and did all drinke the ſame Spirituall drinke: for they dranke of the Spirituall Rocke following them; and the Rocke was Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The difference onely is:</p>
               <p>Firſt, In the outward Signes.</p>

                  <hi>The Church,</hi> or as we vſe to ſpeake, and as the Symbole of the Apoſtles hath it, <hi>The holy Catholike Church,</hi> wherein theſe quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties come to be obſerued.</p>
               <p>Firſt, The Church is but one: whether they bee on Earth, drawne by the Word of Chriſt, and the Grace of his holy Spirit to beleeue in him; or in Heauen, there enioying his bleſſed preſence (ſo the Apoſtle doth <note n="k" place="margin">Col. 1. 20. Epheſ. 3. 15.</note> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times deuide it) they make all but <note n="l" place="margin">
                     <hi>Epheſ. 1. 10, 23 Col.</hi> 1. 18.</note> one bodie, whereof Chriſt is the Head.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Catholike or V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuerſall<note place="margin">The Papiſts ridiculous, to call the Romane Church (which if it were admitted a true Church, is but a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Church) by the name of the Catholke Church.</note> it may be called, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing regard both to perſons, places and times: Perſons, as comprehending all GODS Elect, who in their time are all gathered into the boſome of this Church. Wherefore, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 26. the Catholike Church, <hi>Ieruſalem which is aboue,</hi> is ſaid to be <hi>the mother of all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In regard of place: becauſe it is not tyed to any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion or Countrey in particular, but ſcattered through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the World.</p>
               <p>For the times: In all Ages of the World, God hath euer ſome that are his indeed, members of the true Church through faith in him.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The true Church is called holy, becauſe they are indeed and truly the ſanctified members of Chriſt, regenerate and borne againe, in whom he dwelleth and raigneth by his Spirit, being waſhed, iuſtified, ſanctified through him, and hereafter for euer glorified. So as out of this Church there is no Saluation: for there is no
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:29324:215"/> Faith, no Chriſt, but there: and hereof the <note n="m" place="margin">1. Pet. 3. 20, 21.</note> Arke was a Figure, wherein all that were not, periſhed.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The true Church, whileſt it remayneth here on Earth, is inuiſible, becauſe their Faith, which onely maketh them members of the Church, cannot be known or ſeene of any but of thoſe that do receiue it. And if the true Catholike Church might bee ſeene, then were it no Article of our Faith to beleeue it. Howbeit at the laſt Day they ſhall be all ſeene.</p>
               <p>To ſpeake of Faith, which maketh men members of the true Church: Properly it is a vertue and holy quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the Minde and Will, powred into vs by the Holy Ghoſt, for the knowing and apprehending of Chriſt. But as the Scriptures take it, and Diuines commonly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine it, by the worke of Faith, it is a knowledge and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of Chriſt now abſent, with all his benefits offered in the Word to bee ones owne. Howbeit, in ſo great a matter to vſe ſomwhat a more large deſcription, and in one view to lay forth whatſoeuer is neceſſarie to bee knowne of Faith; Faith proper to Gods Elect (for I meddle not here with Hiſtoricall Faith, which
<note n="n" place="margin">1. Iames 2. 19</note> 
                  <hi>Iames</hi> calleth <hi>the faith of Deuils,</hi> nor with <note n="o" place="margin">Mat. 13. 21.</note> temporarie Faith, or the Faith of
<note n="p" place="margin">1. Cor. 13. 2.</note> working Miracles; theſe are but in name onely and abuſe of ſpeech, or if properly Faith, yet not ſauing Faith: but true and ſauing Faith, is a ſpeciall gift and grace of God, wrought in our hearts by the Holy Ghoſt, and that ordinarily by the preaching of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, nouriſhed by the Word and Sacraments: Ioyned it is with Knowledge, not a generall or confuſed know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, but the ſauing knowledge of Gods Children, that apprendeth Chriſt, and applyeth him to euery true Beleeuer: But apprehending Chriſt abſent in his Word, it is mixed with much weakneſſe and vnbeliefe, yet ſtill holdeth faſt and letteth not goe the hold, but continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally groweth, till wee come to ſee Chriſt in his Glorie; and therefore is perpetually waited vpon by Hope, the ſure Anchor of our ſoules.</p>
               <pb n="402" facs="tcp:29324:216"/>
               <p>Now to open more largely the parts of this deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, there bee eight mayne points lye obuious before our eyes:</p>
               <p>Firſt, The nature of Faith.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The perſons to whom it is appropriate.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The cauſes efficient, both primarie and ſecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>darie, principall and inſtrumentall, the begetting and the preſeruing cauſes.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The prerogatiue of the faithfull.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, The qualities or adioynts of Faith.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, Of ſight, the full perfection of it.</p>
               <p>Seuenthly, Of Hope the ſiſter and companion:</p>
               <p>And eightly, the fruits or effects.</p>
               <p>The nature of Faith is to know Chriſt, to lay hold vpon him, and with confidence and aſſurance to apply him to ones ſelfe. Wherein we are to conſider, both the Obiect of Faith, and the Actions.</p>
               <p>The Obiect of Faith is Chriſt: for albeit Faith ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times take hold of a particular promiſe, as the <note n="q" place="margin">Mat. 15. 29.</note> blind men did for the opening of their eyes, yet it reſteth not in that particular good: but thorow it looketh at the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall good, which is Chriſt. But Chriſt is the Obiect of Faith, not as he is in himſelfe and preſent, but abſent in his Word. Whereupon it is called <note n="r" place="margin">2. Theſſ. 2. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>The Faith of Truth,</hi> or that which imbraceth and layeth hold vpon the Word and Truth of God, that is to ſay, the Doctrine of Ieſus Chriſt, and Chriſt himſelfe in and by the ſame. And this Word is the Word of the Couenant, the Word of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation, publiſhed and preached, and ſealed vp by the Sacraments: in regard whereof, it is alſo called
<note n="ſ" place="margin">Phil. 1. 27.</note> 
                  <hi>The Faith of the Goſpell.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that to ſpeake properly, Faith ſeeth not ſo much Chriſt himſelfe, as a certaine Image and Picture of Chriſt in his Word and Sacraments, wherein wee behold him, but as it were, in a Looking-glaſſe. So <hi>Paul</hi> telleth the <hi>Galatians, Gal.</hi> 3. 1. that by the Goſpell which hee prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:29324:216"/> vnto them, <hi>Ieſus Chriſt was pictured out before their eyes, and among them crucified.</hi> And hereof are the ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, 1. <hi>Cor. 13. 22. We ſee now as it were in a Glaſſe, in a Riddle, 2. Cor. 3. 18. But we all with open face beholding as in a Glaſſe the Glorie of the Lord, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Actions are three, to know, to apprehend, to apply.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Faith hath her ſeat in the mind and vnderſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of man: for without knowing of Chriſt, how can one embrace and lay hold vpon him, ſince no <note n="t" place="margin">Ignoti nulla Cupido.</note> man longeth for that he knoweth not? This is apparant by thoſe titles which are giuen to Faith euery-where in the Scripture, as where it is called Knowledge, Vnderſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Sight, <hi>Iohn 6. 40. Euerie one that ſeeth the Sonne, and beleeueth in him, ſhall haue euerlasting life.</hi> Wherefore, 1. <hi>Iohn</hi> 4. 16. theſe two are ioyned together, <hi>Wee know, and beleeue.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Faith and other Knowledges differ thus: Knowledge is by Reaſon, or from the Teſtimonie of the Sences; Faith grounding vpon the authority and truth of him that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth, giueth a
<note n="u" place="margin">Heb. 11. 1.</note> being to things that are not, or bee inuiſible.</p>
               <p>Secondly, In Faith there is an aſſent of the mind, and certaintie or aſſurance, that the promiſes of the Goſpell are true and good, not onely in generall, but eſpecially to and of ones ſelfe: for there is a double knowledge of Chriſt, one, a generall knowledge, which the
<note n="x" place="margin">Iam. 2. 19.</note> Deuils haue, and tremble, the other proper to the faithfull, which is an apprehending Knowledge, or knowing apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>When</hi>
                  <note n="y" place="margin">Iohn 6. 40. &amp; 12. 44, 45.</note> 
                  <hi>men ſee and beleeue in him.</hi> And this aſſurance euery one that beleeueth, hath, (for ſeeing Faith where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we enioy Chriſt) is nothing elſe but to lay hold vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, and to receiue him as our owne, how weake ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer ones hold bee (for that maketh not a difference of Faith from other things, but onely of the meaſure and degree of Faith) it followeth, that euery mans conſcience<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <pb n="404" facs="tcp:29324:217"/> may aſſure him, whether hee beleeue, and ſo haue Chriſt or no, as his ſences can tell him, whether hee reach forth his hand or no. Therefore the Apoſtle ſaith,
<note n="z" place="margin">1. Iohn 5. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>Hee that beleeueth, hath this teſtimony in himſelfe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Howbeit, wee cannot ſay, that aſſurance is an inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable companion of Faith alwayes and at all times; for as a hand that is benummed, may hold a thing, though it doth not feele nor diſcerne the hold it hath: ſo may it be in Faith, That though indeed and truely it apprehend Chriſt, yet ſometime by the rage and violence of ſinne, that lulleth vs aſleepe, and ſometimes by other meanes it may fall out, that wee ſhall haue no ſence nor feeling that we haue him.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The peculiar and ſpeciall propertie wherein the verie point of Faith doth lye, is in the heart and will, particularly applying to one ſelfe that which he iudged to bee ſo true and good; for Faith is the hand of the ſoule, to apprehend Chriſt, and lay hold vpon him, as the hand of the bodie apprehendeth outward things, and layeth hold vpon them: And therefore hereby wee apply Chriſt vnto our ſelues, and receiue him for our owne. And this to be the nature of Faith, the Euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſt expreſly teacheth, when hee ſaith, <note n="a" place="margin">Iohn 1. 12.</note> 
                  <hi>As many as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued him</hi> (or laid hold vpon him) <hi>he gaue them this dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, to bee the ſonnes of God, euen to thoſe that beleeue in his Name.</hi> And againe,
<note n="b" place="margin">Iohn 6. 35.</note> 
                  <hi>He that commeth vnto me, ſhall neuer hunger; and he that beleeueth in me, ſhall neuer thirſt.</hi> Where <hi>comming vnto Chriſt,</hi> is expounded by the words following of <hi>beleeuing in him,</hi> and that this carryeth with it a particular application, as the word it ſelfe doth ſhew. So the Apoſtle
<note n="c" place="margin">1. Pe. 1. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>Peter</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Papiſts teach, that Faith lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth hold onely vpon a general mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie propounded generally to the Church, and not offered particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the ſeuerall members thereof.</note> doth more expreſly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, when he calleth it <hi>The ſprinkling of the bloud of Chriſt,</hi> particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly and ſpecially applyed to our ſoules, for the waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:29324:217"/> and ſcowring of them; for albeit the promiſes of the Goſpel are generall, <note n="d" place="margin">Ioh. 3 16.</note> 
                  <hi>Whoſoeuer beleeueth in the Son, ſhall not periſh, but haue life euerlaſting:</hi> yet the ſame are to be vnderſtood ſingularly and particularly, as if they were ſpoken to thee and mee, and to euery one by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in ſeuerall: Otherwiſe, what ſhould our faith differ from the faith of the

               <p>Wherefore we muſt vnderſtand, that God, to ſpeake properly, doth not require the ſame, as a mutuall reſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

So as the whole Couenant properly and in truth riſeth of his part, and lyeth vpon him: Like his other Couenant
<note n="q" place="margin">Ier. 31. 35, 36.</note> (brought to confirme this) with the Sun and Moone and Starres, whom (otherwiſe vnable of themſelues) he maketh to runne their courſe: But howſoeuer, <note n="r" place="margin">Ier. 32. 39.

               <p>And herein lieth one other maine difference between the Law and the Goſpel, or the couenant of Works, and this couenant of Grace: The Law onely commandeth obedience, but giueth no power to obey; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is called, <note n="u" place="margin">2. Cor. 3. 3, 6, 8, 9.</note> 
                  <hi>The dead Letter, written with Inke, and in Tables of Stone,</hi> readie indeed to be read and ſeene, but hauing no life in it to change the heart, which remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth as ſtonie as before. The Goſpel not onely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth, but giueth faith and newneſſe of life; and is therefore ſaid <hi>to be written in our hearts,</hi> and called <hi>The miniſtration of the Spirit,</hi> becauſe it giueth the Spirit of Chriſt, and righteouſneſſe through him.</p>
               <p>The Law therefore pronouncing nothing but Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and condemnation againſt vs, as that which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth things impoſſible, by reaſon of our weakeneſſe, terrifieth and amazeth the conſcience: In which reſpect it is called, <note n="x" place="margin">2. Cor. 3. 7, 9.</note> 
                  <hi>The miniſterie of death and condemnation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Contrariwiſe, the Goſpel bringing glad tidings of peace and reconciliation, quieteth &amp; appeaſeth the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, <hi>Rom. 5. 1. Being iustified by faith, wee haue peace with God, through Ieſus Chriſt our Lord.</hi> Both parts of this difference are found, <hi>Rom. 10. 5, 6, 7, 8. For</hi> MO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SES <hi>thus deſcribeth the righteouſneſſe which is of the Law, that the man which doth theſe things, ſhall liue thereby. But the righteouſneſſe which is of faith, ſpeaketh on this wiſe, Say not in thine heart, Who ſhall aſcend into heauen? That is to bring Chriſt from aboue. Or, Who ſhall deſcend into the deepe? That is to bring Chriſt againe from the dead. But what ſaith it? The Word is neere thee, euen in thy mouth
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:29324:219"/> and in thine heart. This is the Word of Faith which wee preach.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But if God beſtow faith vpon all and euery of his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, what ſhall wee then ſay of Infants that dye in the Mothers Wombe, or aſſoone as they are borne, who cannot, as it ſeemeth, properly bee ſaid to haue faith, and yet neuertheleſſe we cannot deny but the
<note n="x" place="margin">Mat. 19. 14.</note> King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God doth appertayne vnto them? If it bee cleere that Infants haue no faith, then wee muſt needes ſay, the Spirit of God in ſome other vnſpeakeable man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner vniteth them vnto Chriſt. But (yeelding all due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to other mens opinions) I ſhould thinke that were rather a <hi>quaere,</hi> then a ruled caſe: for</p>
               <p>Firſt, As they haue knowledge and other faculties of the minde, without which no reaſonable ſoule conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth: ſo I doe not ſee but they may haue ſupernaturall Grace, ſome ſeedes of the habit of faith for the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending of Chriſt, that are of the nature of faith, and faith it ſelfe in a kind (which how ſmall ſoeuer, ſufficeth to ſaluation) doth the weakneſſe of the Organ of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die make it impoſſible for God to worke ſupernaturally in their ſoule? and to giue to little children whome his purpoſe is to ſaue, at the leaſt ſo much illumination of the minde (more then is ordinarie for that age) as may bee fit to receiue the Grace of Chriſt? Thoſe, whom in a moment, and at an inſtant, as ſoone as they are taken vp into Heauen, hee filleth with a whole Sea of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and Vnderſtanding of Chriſt, more then all the Prophets and Apoſtles had whileſt they liued vpon the Earth, can hee not immediately before, ſprinkle them with one iot of Knowledge, aſmuch Faith as the graine of a Muſtard Seed; and make them by the tip of the hand of the ſoule, and, as it were, the fingers end, to touch him, whom they ſhall immediately haue the full fruition of?</p>
               <p>Secondly, The example of <hi>Iacob is</hi> very forceable for
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:29324:219"/> his, and his brothers ruſhing together in the Wombe, or daſhing one againſt another. <hi>Iacobs</hi> holding of <hi>Eſau</hi> by the heele, the Prophet

                  <hi>Ieremie</hi> was ſanctified before hee came out of the Wombe: and <note n="a" place="margin">Luke 1. 15.</note> 
                  <hi>Iohn the Baptiſt</hi> filled with the Holy Ghoſt, being yet in his Mothers belly: ſhall we thinke, that in the Wombe they were in Chriſt, and ſo ſanctified one way, and when they came to yeeres of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, by another?</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Foraſmuch as there is but one way of ioyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vs to Chriſt, when wee come to Heauen, which is <note n="b" place="margin">2.

               <p>Fiftly, Of any other way or meanes for Infants to come by Righteouſneſſe or Saluation, but by beleeuing (the condition of the Couenant of Grace, as doing is of the Couenant of workes) the Scripture (ſo farre as I can learne) ſpeaketh not a Word; but to the contrarie giueth generall and vniuerſall rules, without any incling of exception, as <hi>Iohn 17. 3. This is life euerlaſting, to know thee the onely true God, and him whom thou haſt ſent, Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> Therefore ſome ſparke of knowledge cannot bee denyed to theſe, who hauing the Sonne, <note n="f" place="margin">

                  <hi>Whatſoeuer the Father giueth mee,</hi> (meaning all thoſe whom God in his euerlaſting counſell hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to be Chriſts) <hi>ſhall come vnto mee,</hi> or beleeue in mee.

So the ſimilitude, which our Sauiour doth inforce, <hi>Iohn 3. 14.

               <p>But of this enough: we come vnto the cauſes.</p>
               <p>Faith commeth not from our ſelues; it commeth from the Holy Ghoſt, and is the ſpeciall worke of the Spirit of Chriſts, a may appeare by the Prayer of the Apoſtles, <hi>Lord,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>This worke of the Spirit making vs ſo to beleeue, is termed <hi>A drawing of vs to Christ, Iohn 6. 4. Cant. 1. 3. A Calling, Rom.</hi> 8. 30. but in a more ſtrict ſignification then the calling ſpoken of before, and many wayes dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering from it: for</p>
               <p>That is but a Calling to the Profeſſion of Chriſt; and therefore outward and externall onely: This, to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation and enioying of Chriſt himſelfe; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a true and effectuall Calling.</p>
               <p>That but to the viſible Church: This to be a member of the true Catholike and inuiſible Church of God. The cauſe that moueth God to beſtow this gift of Faith vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vs, is his owne ſpeciall Grace, and the good pleaſure of his Will. So ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Phil. 1. 29. To you it is freely giuen to beleeue in Chriſt.</hi> and <hi>Acts 28. 27. Hee did much helpe them that had beleeued through Grace.</hi> We come therefore to apprehend Chriſt, onely becauſe through his Grace and Goodneſſe wee are apprehended of him.<note place="margin">wrought (or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily) by preaching.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The onely inſtrument that God vſeth ordinarily to beget faith, is the preaching of the Word, as the <note n="r" place="margin">Ro. 10. 14, 17.</note> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſaith, <hi>How can they beleeue in him, of whom they haue not heard? and how can they heare, without a Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher?</hi> concluding; <hi>Therefore Faith is by hearing, and hearing by the Word</hi> or Ordinance <hi>of God.</hi> And

Being borne againe, not of corruptible ſeed, but of incorruptible. That is the Word of God, who liueth and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bideth for euer,</hi> which maketh much to commend the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie and neceſſitie of GODS holy Ordinance of Preaching.</p>
               <p>Not that preaching hath this fruit and effect by any naturall vertue or power that is in it, but by the <note n="a" place="margin">Rom. 10. 17.</note> Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance and Bleſſing of God, who vſeth to hide and conceale his owne ſupernaturall worke in our conuerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as it is the Glorie of God to hide his counſell, <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerbs</hi> 25. 2.</p>
               <p>Neither in ſaying ſo, do we tye God vnto the meanes, as though without Preaching it could not bee wrought at all: for as in the things of nature, he is not tyed vnto the meanes, being himſelfe the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Lord of nature: no more muſt we iudge him in this worke aboue nature, wherein hee taketh glorie to himſelfe, to deale how and which way he will in an extraordinarie ſort.

               <p>In the ruinous eſtate of the CHVRCH, when there wanteth a ſet and ſtabliſhed forme of gouernment, it pleaſeth him many times to bleſſe the very ſound of the Word, though it bee but read or talked of, and
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:29324:221"/> ſometimes other meanes ſo farre as to make it effectuall for the planting of faith in the heart; as <hi>Iohn</hi> 4. 39. ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the <hi>Samaritanes</hi> were brought to beleeue in Chriſt, onely vpon the womans wordes, which bare re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord of him.

               </p>
               <p>Of the extraordinarie worke, in reſpect of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, we haue an example in the courſe which it pleaſeth him to take with Infants that are not come to yeeres of diſcretion and vnderſtanding, as alſo with men of age, which haue not capacitie; bee it naturall fooles, madde men or deafe-borne, in whom the Spirit of God worketh immediately without this outward Miniſterie.</p>

                  <hi>Abraham</hi> for an Example, <hi>Who was not weake through vnbeliefe, but was ſtrengthened in the Faith, and gaue glory to God, being fully aſſured that what he had promiſed, he was able alſo to do.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Our faith being weake, is through the gracious ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration<note place="margin">yet confirmed by the Word &amp; Sacraments, Prayer and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther holy meanes,</note> of the ſame Spirit that firſt wrought it, ſtrengthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and ſupported by the Word and Sacraments, which are the nouriſhing and preſeruing cauſes; that ſo long as heere we liue, wee haue a continuall need of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie and all other holy meanes. Whereupon <hi>Paul</hi> bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the <hi>Theſſalonians</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Another thing proper vnto Faith is this, that where<note place="margin">it neuer let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth goe the hold</note> all other Gifts and Graces of the Spirit, if they haue not Faith (which is the Roote) may wither and come to nothing, this neuer can bee loſt, but groweth to the end.</p>
               <p>Wherefore out of this one Roote, two branches, as it were, doe ſpring. And becauſe they are both wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie of ſpeciall conſideration, it ſhall not be amiſſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly to ſpeake of them.</p>
               <p>One, (which is the ſecond qualitie of Faith) that he which once hath this Faith, is ſure to haue it ſtill. So ſaith our Sauiour Chriſt, <hi>Luke</hi> 22. 31. in the perſon of
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:29324:222"/> 
                  <hi>Peter,</hi> giuing a perpetuall comfort to all that are his, <hi>I haue prayed for thee, that thy Faith ſhould not faile.</hi> In an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other place hee ſaith,
<note n="k" place="margin">Iohn 6. 35.</note> 
                  <hi>He that commeth vnto me, ſhall neuer hunger, and he that beleeueth in me, ſhall neuer thirſt.</hi> Agreeable whereunto is that of IOHN,
<note n="l" place="margin">1. Iohn 2. 19.</note> 
                  <hi>They went out from among vs, but they were not of vs: for if they had beene of vs, they would haue abidden with vs.</hi> For this is that ſweete and euerlaſting promiſe that God hath made vnto his Church, <note n="m" place="margin">Ier. 32. 39, 40</note> 
                  <hi>I will not put my feare into their hearts, that they ſhall neuer depart away from mee all the dayes of their life.</hi> And excellent to this purpoſe is the ſpeech of our Sauiour Chriſt, <note n="n" place="margin">Iohn 10. 27, 28, 29, 30.</note> 
                  <hi>My ſheepe heare my voyce, and I know them, and they follow me, and I giue euerlasting Life vnto them, and they ſhall neuer periſh, neither ſhall any pull them out of my hand. My Father which hath giuen them me, is greater then all; and none can pull them out of my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers hand; I and my Father are one.</hi> And againe, <note n="o" place="margin">Iohn 6. 37, 39, 40.</note>

               </p>
               <p>To conclude that which is ſaid, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 18. that <hi>the gates of Hell ſhall not preuaile againſt the Church,</hi> muſt needs bee true of euery one which by Faith is made a member of the Church. So that our faith, how weake ſoeuer it be in it ſelfe, yet it is firme and ſtrong, in, and through him that hath promiſed to hold it vp: ſo as all aduerſarie powers ſhall not be able to root it out; which is the fulneſſe of excellencie purchaſed for vs by Chriſt; that being quickened from death, and a ſpirituall life put into vs, we are no more at our owne hand, left to keepe our ſelues, and ſo in danger to loſe all againe, as <hi>Adam</hi> did; but haue the promiſe of a continuall ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port and ſtay, by the mightie working of Chriſts Spirit, till we come to his heauenly Kingdome, where is nothing but Eternitie: And therefore he that once beleeueth, is ſaid <note n="p" place="margin">Iohn 3. 36.</note> alreadie to <hi>haue eternall Life, to</hi>

               <p>The other point, which is the third qualitie of faith,<note place="margin">but continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly groweth,</note> is, that continually it groweth.

               <p>Faith, euen when it ceaſeth to bee Faith (for as wee<note place="margin">till we come to ſee Chriſt in his Glorie:</note> reade, 1. <hi>Cor. 13. 13. Now</hi> and no longer, <hi>abideth Faith</hi>) yet euen then we cannot giue her loſt, ſince ſhe groweth into a greater and a farre ſurpaſſing light to ſee Chriſt in his heauenly Kingdome: for Faith is in this life, and ſight in the World to come, as the Apoſtle doth diſtinguiſh them, 2. <hi>Cor. 5. 7. Wee walke by Faith, and not by Sight.</hi> And <note n="g" place="margin">1. Pet. 1. 8.</note> PETER, <hi>Whom though yee ſee him not, yet ye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue in him.</hi> Sight therefore hath place in the next World, and apprehendeth Chriſt, as hee is in himſelfe then preſent, without this Glaſſe of the Word and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments. 1. <hi>Iohn 3. 2.

               <p>The Kingdome of Grace, which is, and ſtandeth by faith, and therefore by the Word (the ſubiect of faith) ordinarily, that in the Church of beleeuers the Word and the Spirit doe alwaies goe together, the Church ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer deſtitute of the Spirit, the Spirit neuer ſeparated from the Word.

               <p>I verily thinke, the <hi>Pſalmist</hi> ſo long before pointed at it, when he ſaith,
<note n="e" place="margin">Pſal. 118. 24.</note> 
                  <hi>This ſame Day</hi> (wherein Chriſt,

               <p>And what maruell though the Day ſuffered a change, when the whole World it ſelfe was changed?</p>
               <p>This, beſides the change of the Day it ſelfe, brought<note place="margin">and</note> with it two other notable changes alſo:</p>
               <p>Firſt, Of the name: from the Sabbath, to bee called<note place="margin">called the Lords Day,</note> by a greater and more honourable Title, <note n="h" place="margin">Reuel. 1. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>The Lords Day,</hi> conſecrated to his Seruice. So as the very name is become a Badge of our Chriſtian and holy Profeſſion, ſeuering vs from <hi>Iewes, Turkes,</hi> and other Enemies to the Name of Chriſt. Neither ſhall you finde in all the New Teſtament, that the Day which the Churches celebrate, was, at any time after Chriſts Aſcenſion, called <hi>The Sabbath Day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, In that it beginneth not on the Euening of<note place="margin">beginning when he aroſe, and began to renew the World.</note> the Day before, as the <hi>Iewiſh</hi> Sabbaths did, but at the dawning of the Day, when <note n="i" place="margin">Marke 16. 9. Iohn 20. 1.</note> our Sauiour beganne the worke of his Reſurrection.</p>
               <p>Now, that the Day which wee are to ſanctifie, begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth at that time, is made good by the practice of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> who tarrying at <hi>Troas</hi> ſeuen whole dayes, preached vpon this Day, and continue in his Sermon vnto mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, ſpent the reſt of the night in holy conference vnto the dawning of the day, and then departed, <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 7, 11.</p>

               <p>Regeneration being firſt, and the ground-worke of<note place="margin">Regeneration is</note> the reſt, we are to ſee what Regeneration is.</p>
               <p>I define it to bee our ſpirituall incorporating into Chriſt; betweene which and the worke of Sanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the difference lyeth plaine: for as Creation is diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed from the qualities wherein men were created: ſo is this <hi>Now Creation</hi> from the qualities whereunto wee are regenerate. And as Generation is one thing, and the corruption that Parents beget vs in, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: ſo is our New birth, one thing; and the Holineſſe or Sanctification which we haue thereby, another.

Now yee are the Bodie of Chriſt, and members particularly: And theſe God hath ſet in the Church, first, Apoſtles, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, As the Vine and branches are of one<note place="margin">whereby be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one with him and through him with God.</note> nature, the man and wife one fleſh, the head &amp; the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers one Bodie: ſo wee are one with Chriſt, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently one, one with another, as a Syens ingraffed on the arme of a Tree, is both one with the Arme, and with the Tree it ſelfe. This our Sauiour teacheth moſt ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>Iohn 17. 21. That all may be one, as thou, Father, in me, and I in thee, that they alſo may be one in vs.</hi> And by reaſon of this vnion which the members haue with the head, and euery member one with another, it is that the whole bodie (that is to ſay, Chriſt himſelfe the Head, and all the Church which are his members) are called
<note n="n" place="margin">1. Cor. 11. 12.</note> 
                  <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as we heard before. And ſo taking Chriſt together with his Elect the Catholike Church is called, <hi>The Mother of the Spouſe himſelfe, Cant.</hi> 8. 2. and the Church (that is, all the Elect) <hi>his Siſter, Cant. 4<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 9. and</hi> 8. 8.</p>
               <pb n="434" facs="tcp:29324:232"/>
               <p>The third thing is Adoption, or the making of vs the<note place="margin">we become children by Adoption,</note> ſonnes of God by grace, being regenerate, and borne againe in Chriſt, who is the Sonne of God by nature: as it is ſaid, <note n="o" place="margin">Iohn 1. 12. 13</note> 
                  <hi>To them that receyued him, hee gaue this dignitie, to bee the ſonnes of God:</hi>
                  <note n="p" place="margin">Gal. 3. 17.</note> 
                  <hi>for all of you are the ſonnes of God by faith in Chriſt Ieſus.</hi>

                  <hi>When the fulneſſe of time came, God ſent forth his Sonne, &amp;c. that wee might receiue the Adoption.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, Beeing one with Chriſt, wee alſo haue his<note place="margin">and haue his Spirit to be ours.</note> Spirit to bee ours: for <hi>if any man haue not the Spirit of Chriſt, the ſame is not his,</hi> Rom. 8. 9. <hi>Becauſe yee are ſons,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Gal. 4. 6. God hath ſent forth the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of his Sonne into your hearts, crying,</hi> Abba, <hi>Father.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And hereupon the Spirit of Chriſt, whom we receiue, is called, <hi>The Spirit of Adoption,</hi> Rom. 8. 15.</p>
               <p>Now let vs in a few words recapitulate the ſumme of all we are to know concerning Regeneration, for ſo we ſhall make a better paſſage to that which followeth.</p>
               <p>Firſt, It is a meere <note n="r" place="margin">Pſal 102. 18. Eſay 65. 18. B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e glad, &amp;c. yee whom I create, Eph. 2. 10. Gal. 6. 15.</note> Creation. God findeth no more matter to worke vpon for the making of a man anew, then when he made that lumpe whereof heauen &amp; earth were framed.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the manner of this Creation is by a new birth, when <hi>a hollow perſon,</hi> (one as emptie and voyd of heart, as the hollow of a tree is of ſubſtance) <hi>is made to haue a heart, and a wild Aſſe-Colt borne, a man,</hi> (by ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall Regeneration) as <hi>Tſophar</hi> ſpeaketh, <hi>Iob</hi> 11. 12. A maruailous &amp; a ſtrange birth, wherin there is no more matter to beget him of, then there is in the hollow of a tree, to fetch out heart of Oke.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Therefore this Birth is not naturall, as pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents beget their children; but legall, as <hi>Iechonias</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat <hi>Salathiel,</hi> whether hee adopted him, or rather, that as next of DAVIDS line, without adoption, he ſuccee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the gouernement. But howſoeuer it were in the
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:29324:232"/> caſe of <hi>Salathiel,</hi> we ſpeake of that which is adoptiue.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, There is a difference of this Adoption from all other: for men adopt children when themſelues are childleſſe. God hauing a Son of his own, adopteth vs vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, &amp; therfore all Adoption <note n="ſ" place="margin">Eph. 1. 15.</note> is in &amp; through Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, Becauſe GOD was purpoſed to bring ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny children this way vnto glorie, it pleaſed him to found a moſt noble Incorporation, whereof all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bodies politique are but counterfait. Of this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporation, Chriſt, God and man, is the Head, all beeing adopted by him, and incorporated into him, the members are euerie one Kings and Prieſts; two of the moſt ſacred and venerable things that euer were in the world: euen among the Heathen, the bone and ligament that tyeth all together, is the holy Spirit; the ſoule, as it were of this Incorporation: That where o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Corporations are ſaid to conſiſt of a bodie with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a ſoule, this hath the Spirit of God himſelfe to bee the ſoule of it. So the Apoſtle teacheth, 1. <hi>Cor. 12. 13. By one Spirit wee are all baptized into one Bodie, and all made to drinke into one Spirit.</hi> Againe, <note n="t" place="margin">Eph. 4. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>There is one Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, and one Spirit</hi> that knitteth all the parts together.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, Therefore alſo we liue <note n="u" place="margin">Gal. 5. 25.</note> all by one Spirit, the ſame Spirit that quickned our Head, quickning alſo vs that are his members, in that whoſoeuer is Chriſts, hath his Spirit, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 11. The verie words of the promiſe imply as much, <note n="x" place="margin">Ezech. 36. 27</note> 
                  <hi>I will put my Spirit in the midſt of them.</hi> And thereupon is the Goſpel called, <note n="y" place="margin">2. Cor. 3. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>The miniſterie of the Spirit.</hi> And <note n="z" place="margin">Gal. 3. 2.</note> PAVL ſaith, <hi>Receyued ye the Spirit by the workes of the Law, or by the hearing of faith?</hi> And as certainely and verily as the naturall man liueth by his reaſonable ſoule, ſo certainely and verily doth the Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate man liue by the Spirit dwelling in him, beeing now no more a naturall man (ſo farre as he is Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate) but hauing all his life from and in that Bodie po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litique: <note n="a" place="margin">Gal. 1. 20.</note> 
                  <hi>I liue no more, I, but Chriſt liueth in me.</hi> 
                  <note n="b" place="margin">Coloſſ. 3. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>When
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:29324:233"/> Chriſt which is our life ſhall be manifested, &amp;c.</hi> Therefore is the whole Bodie (comprehending both the Head and members) called <note n="c" place="margin">1. Cor. 12. 12.</note> 
                  <hi>Chriſt;</hi> and euerie particular, <note n="d" place="margin">Iohn 3. 6. 1. Iohn 5. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>Spirit:</hi> becauſe, as he is begotten of the Spirit, ſo he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth in and by the Spirit.</p>
               <p>This is the ſumme of all; whereunto let me adde</p>
               <p>Firſt, Where the Spirit is, it <note n="e" place="margin">Acts 15. 9.</note> purifieth and clenſeth the heart, maketh all whole and cleane, as a griffe ſet into a Stock, doth alter and change the nature of it: wherefore Sanctification of the whole man, is an vnſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable companion of the Regenerate eſtate; <note n="f" place="margin">Iohn 3. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>That which is borne of the Spirit, is Spirit,</hi> heauenly, and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That liuing in the Spirit, it is as naturall for vs (ſo farre as wee doe liue in the Spirit, that is to ſay, are Regenerate, and conſequently ſanctified) to bring forth the fruits of the Spirit, <hi>Loue, Ioy, Peace,</hi> &amp;c. as they are reckoned, <hi>Gola.</hi> 5. 22. as it is for fire to burne, for the wind to blow, &amp;c. which is it the Apoſtle ſaith there, <note n="g" place="margin">Gal. 5. 25.</note> 
                  <hi>If wee liue in the Spirit, let vs alſo walke by the Spirit.</hi> And ſo are the graces of the Spirit diſtingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed from the Spirit dwelling in vs, as the effects from the cauſe, in the verie ſame manner, as the worke of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning and diſputing is, from our reaſonable ſoule it ſelfe.</p>
               <p>But of theſe two things (the worthie fruits and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of Regeneration) wee are to ſpeake in that which followeth.</p>
               <p>Of a Regenerate eſtate, there be two degrees, as it<note place="margin">Sealed vp du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancie of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation,</note> were two ages; Infancie, and Mans eſtate: of both which the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, <hi>Eph. 4. 14. Till we meet all together in the vnitie of Faith, and of the knowledge of the Sonne of God, vnto a perfect man, vnto the meaſure of the age of the fulneſſe of Chriſt, that we may be no more children, &amp;c.</hi> And 1. <hi>Cor. 13. 10. When that which is perfect ſhall come, then that which is in part, ſhall be done away. When I
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:29324:233"/> was a child, I ſpake as a child, I reaſoned as a child. But when I became a man, I put away the conceits of a child.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Infancie of Regeneration, I call that weake in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception which is in vs during this preſent life, wherein we are yet as little children ſcarce come out of the ſhell:
<note n="h" place="margin">

                  <hi>New-borne babes,</hi> as PETER calleth vs, <note n="i" place="margin">Rom. 8. 23.</note> 
                  <hi>which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue</hi> but <hi>the firſt fruits of the Spirit,</hi> or onely, <note n="k" place="margin">2. Cor. 1. 22.</note> 
                  <hi>a pawne</hi> or pledge, the earneſt penny of the Spirit: for as in the naturall birth of a man, his bodie commeth not into the world ſo great and ſtrong as afterwards it proueth, but ſmall, weake, and impotent: ſo in the ſpirituall birth of Regeneration, the ſoule of man is not at the firſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment indued with perfection, but muſt grow and go on forwards to it.<note place="margin">(which is all our life long)</note>
               </p>
               <p>I meane not that this Infancie is the firſt act of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation: for there be ſome that are borne (in reſpect of others) ſtrong in Chriſt, and Giants the firſt day, as was the Apoſtle <hi>Paul.</hi> But I meane the whole progreſſe alſo, and continuance all our life, euen in the beſt: And ſo doth the Apoſtle, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 11. bring the ſimilitude of childe-hood and mans eſtate, not to note the beginning and proceeding in Chriſtianitie, but to ſet forth the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie in heauen, aboue that which we attaine vnto being here.</p>
               <p>To this eſtate, theſe foure things are proper: Firſt, In euerie man Regenerate, there be, as it were, two men deuided; the old, and the new man. The old man, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led alſo the outward man, the fleſh the members, (for we carrie about vs a whole bodie of ſinne) is ſo much of vs whatſoeuer it be, within or without, that is naturall and left yet vnregenerate. The new man, called alſo the inner man, the Spirit, the minde, is our part Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and borne againe, wherein being freed from ſinne, we begin to bring forth fruits to God. And that both theſe are in one and the ſame man, we are taught, <hi>Math. 26. 41. The Spirit is readie, but the fleſh is weake. 1. Cor.</hi>
                  <pb n="438" facs="tcp:29324:234"/> 5. 5. <hi>Deliuer ſuch a one to Satan, to the deſtruction of the fleſh, that the Spirit may bee ſaued in the Day of the Lord Ieſus. Gal. 5. 17. The fleſh luſteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit againſt the fleſh, that yee cannot doe the things you would. Rom. 7. 25. Therefore I my ſelfe in the minde ſerue the Law of God. but in the fleſh the law of ſinne:</hi> and in a number of other places.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, That it is not a worke to bee ſeene and<note place="margin">in our owne inward aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the Spirit, not in the Worlds diſcerning of it;</note> knowne of men, as that other ſhall be manifeſt vnto all. But euery mans conſcience muſt aſſure him for himſelfe, and of other in whom there bee ſignes and likelihoods, we are to hope the beſt; wherefore the Apoſtle, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 3. ſaith, <hi>That our life is hid with God in Chriſt, not to be manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted till Chriſt our Life doe manifeſt himſelfe. For</hi>
                  <note n="l" place="margin">1. Iohn 3. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>this cauſe,</hi> ſaith another, <hi>the World knoweth vs not, becauſe it know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not him. Beloued, now are we the Children of God, but it is not yet made manifeſt what we ſhall be.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, In this infancie there is yet a continuall<note place="margin">and growing,</note> growth, till we come to the full meaſure of a perfect man in Chriſt: And that is it which the Apoſtle ſaith, 2. <hi>Cor. 4. 16. that the inner man is renewed daily;</hi> as hee doth more largely declare it, <hi>Epheſ. 4. 15, 16. Being ſincere in loue, let vs grow vp in him in all things, who is the Head, euen Chriſt, of whom all the whole bodie knit together and compact by all the ioynts, furniſhed through the power within, working</hi> of Chriſt, our Head, quickening all the parts, as the Soule doth the Bodie, <hi>according to the meaſure of euery member, receiueth an increaſe fit for the bodie, to the building vp of it ſelfe through loue, Coloſ. 2. 19. By whom,</hi> or from whom, that is to ſay, from Chriſt the Head, <hi>all the Bodie furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed and knit together by ioynts and bands, increaſeth with the increaſe of God.</hi> And hither thoſe two Parables be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>Mat.</hi> 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Fiftly, That the meaſure and proportion of our<note place="margin">according as our Faith doth grow.</note> growth, is the meaſure &amp; proportion of our Faith, as the Apoſtle ſheweth there, <note n="m" place="margin">Epheſ. 4. 13.</note> that <hi>the vnity of Faith</hi> bringeth
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:29324:234"/> the perfection of the Bodie of Chriſt. So as the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter wee be in Faith, the ſtronger wee are in Chriſt; if of ſmall Faith, then weake Babes in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>The full perfection and accompliſhment of Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration<note place="margin">After com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth that perfect Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, which the Scripture cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth mans eſtate.</note> ſhall then bee, <hi>When wee haue attayned the marke, and are made perfect,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 12. Therefore this degree is termed, Mans eſtate: and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by a note of excellencie aboue the other, hath the name of Regeneration appropriate vnto it, as appeareth by conference of <hi>Mat.</hi> 19. 28. with <hi>Marke</hi> 10. 30. where that which <hi>Matthew</hi> nameth <hi>Regeneration,</hi> is called <hi>The World to come:</hi> for then indeed doth our Spirituall Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage beginne, all our life here being, as it were, <note n="n" place="margin">Cant. 4. 7, 8.</note> the bidding, or as the betrothing of a Wife.

And in euery of theſe good things is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed the remoouing of the contrarie. Wiſdome ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not with Ignorance and Blindneſſe: Righteouſneſſe putteth away the guilt of ſin: Sanctification, the power and dominion of ſinne: for where one of theſe is, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cannot bee. Redemption ſpeaketh more cleerly of freeing vs from wrath, and the curſe of the Law.</p>
               <p>Wiſdome and Righteouſneſſe (from the which the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther two doe flow) were, for their ſurpaſſing excellencie, figured in the High Prieſts <hi>Vrim</hi> and <hi>Thummim;</hi> as you haue it taught in the explication of the Ceremonies of the Law. But to handle theſe foure apart:</p>
               <p>The firſt benefit which wee haue by Chriſt, is the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king<note place="margin">Illumination, whereby diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelling dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</note> away of the vaile of ignorance, the blindneſſe that naturally poſſeſſeth our ſoules; as in that place of the <hi>Acts</hi> it is firſt named. And <hi>Eſay 25. 7. He will ſwallow vp the vaile of the face, the vaile that is vpon all people, and the couering that is vpon all Nations.</hi> So 2. <hi>Cor. 3. 16.

               </p>
               <p>But this is not all. In ſtead of the Light of Nature (turned through ſinne into palpable and groſſe dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe) we haue now another manner of light, an heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and Spirituall Wiſdome. A grace diſtinct, not onely from Knowledge that went before, which was common
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:29324:236"/> to the Reprobate, whereas this is the peculiar of GODS Heritage: but euen from Faith, though the ſame include Knowledge in it: for Faith is the Inſtrument of Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, <hi>Iohn</hi> 1. 12. and therefore before it in nature: but this Wiſdome commeth in nature after Regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for ſo the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Yee are of God in Christ, who is made vnto vs Wiſdome,</hi> and <hi>Coloſſ. 3. 20.

                  <hi>vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Knowledge,</hi> (which is this Wiſdome.) Therefore in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it commeth after.</p>
               <p>I take it to bee that Light of the Minde, of which the Scripture ſpeaketh ſo oft, comprehending vnder it, by a <hi>Synechdoche,</hi> the whole worke of our Renewing, <hi>Epheſ. 5. 8. Ye were once darkneſſe, but now are light in the Lord, 2. Cor. 4. 6. God, which commanded that light ſhould ſhine out of darkneſſe, is hee who hath ſhined in your hearts to giue the light of the knowledge of the Glorie of God in the face of Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> In this regard we are ſaid to bee illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated or enlightened, <hi>Heb. 10. 32. to bee tranſlated out of darkneſſe, into his wonderfull light, 1.

               <p>Wiſdome and Sanctification or Holineſſe (both inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in vs) ſeeme to differ thus: Holineſſe is the Renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of vs into the ſtate of Innocencie, which we had by Creation. But this Wiſdome is of a farre more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent mould then the light of Knowledge that <hi>Adam</hi> had: for <hi>Adams</hi> minde was indeed enlightened to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand all morall duties, but ours to the knowledge of things that <note n="u" place="margin">1.

Such a Light as man by nature (when it was at the beſt) could neuer comprehend: And hereby wee
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:29324:236"/> come to haue all the ſecrets, and the whole will of God in Chriſt Ieſus, made knowne vnto vs by his Spirit. A maruailous benefit, ſenſibly to be ſeene euen in this life, that dull and ignorant men become able on a ſudden to conceiue the hidden Myſteries of Chriſtianitie. It is that the Apoſtle ſaith, 1. <hi>Cor. 2. 15. The ſpirituall man diſcerneth all things, in that we haue the minde of the Lord</hi> manifeſted vnto vs through Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Howbeit the illumination of our mindes in this life, hath withall much darkneſſe: for growing wholy by the meanes of the Word, as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Coloſſ. 3. 16. Let the Word of Chriſt dwell richly in you in all Wiſdome:</hi> and to TIMOTHIE,
<note n="y" place="margin">2. Tim. 3. 15.</note> 
                  <hi>Thou hast knowne the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, that are able to make thee wiſe:</hi> wee can know but weakly and imperfectly, becauſe the way and meanes whereby wee come to knowledge by the Miniſterie of man, is weake and imperfect: for <hi>in part wee know,</hi> ſaith the ſame Apoſtle, 1. <hi>Cor. 13. 9. and in part wee prophecie:</hi> that is, we learne but imperfectly, becauſe our Teachers teach and inſtruct vs after a lame and imperfect manner.

               </p>
               <p>Forgiueneſſe of ſinnes I call it, when the guilt and fault of our offences are taken away, pardoned, and forgiuen vs, as if we neuer had committed them; ſo as they come not once in account or reckoning before the Iudgement feat of God againſt vs; which being a benefit of all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits, the Scripture is wont to expreſſe by many formes of ſpeech, <hi>Forgiueneſſe of ſinnes,</hi> that is, the doing and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of them away: <note n="a" place="margin">1.

<pb n="450" facs="tcp:29324:239"/> and of death; for, which was impoſſible to the Law, for that it was weake by reaſon of our fleſh, God ſending his own Sonne in the likeneſſe of ſinfull fleſh, for ſinne hath condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſinne in the fleſh, that that which the Law requireth might bee fulfilled in vs, where the Law of the Spirit of life which is in Chriſt Ieſus</hi> he calleth that perfect and all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient Sanctification of our nature in him, whereby he comming <hi>in the likeneſſe of ſinfull fleſh for ſinne,</hi> that is, to aboliſh ſinne it ſelfe in our nature taken vpon him, <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned,</hi> or which is all one, <hi>aboliſhed ſinne in the fleſh;</hi> meaning in his own perſon, through whoſe perfect San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification of nature made ours, the reliques of ſinne, that our corrupt nature is tainted with, are not imputed to vs; and therefore wee bee free from death and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, being wholly reſtored, euen in our nature, to a greater integritie then we loſt in <hi>Adam.</hi> All which the Apoſtle ſheweth, was in <hi>reſpect of the weakneſſe of the Law, being of no ſtrength by reaſon of the fleſh,</hi> or part vnregenerate, which hindreth the worke of the Law, otherwiſe moſt perfect, and is oppoſite thereto, that it neither can, or will be ſubiect to it: So as <hi>to the end we might fulfill that, which the Law requireth,</hi> which is, to be righteous not in our Actions onely, but in our verie nature, it was neceſſarie ſo to haue it ſanctified in the perſon of Chriſt, not ſupplying that which ours want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, but wholly and altogether ſanctifying vs in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe: And by this meanes it commeth to paſſe, that wee are, after the moſt preciſe and exact rule of the Law, righteous before God, hauing the perfect integritie of our nature abſolutely in Chriſt: for which purpoſe hee ſaith not, might be fulfilled <hi>of vs, but in vs;</hi> ſpeaking of Chriſts owne Sanctitie imputed to vs.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The thorow and perfect obedience which<note place="margin">and Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, to be ours.</note> he performed in the whole courſe of his life, both in the duties to God his Father, and in reſpect of men, with whom he was conuerſant here on Earth: whereby all our
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:29324:239"/> vile and filthy actions not comming into account, our whole life is reckoned moſt abſolutely good and holy, not onely void of ſinne, but full of perfect Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, as the ſame Apoſtle teacheth, <note n="b" place="margin">Rom. 5. 12. to the end of the Chapter.</note> 
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. ſetting it forth by an excellent compariſon of our Sauiour Chriſt with <hi>Adam,</hi> both in the things wherein they agree in this point, and in thoſe wherein they differ. They agree in this, that each conueyeth his owne to thoſe that are his, (whom the Apoſtle therefore calleth <hi>many;</hi> oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing them to that one, whom hee conſidereth as their Head) <hi>Adam,</hi> hee conuayeth both guilt and ſinne vnto condemnation; Chriſt, Righteouſneſſe and Obedience vnto Iuſtification; they differ in this:</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Adam</hi> deriueth it downe by nature vpon all his poſteritie; Chriſt beſtoweth it by grace and fauour, and free imputation.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Adams</hi> one ſinne condemed all; CHRIST iuſtifieth from many ſinnes (not that one onely, but all other.)</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Chriſts Righteouſneſſe is more auaile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and of greater power to ſaue, then <hi>Adams</hi> ſinne was to condemne: for that indeed threw vs downe from the ſtate of Innocencie, but Chriſt hath rayſed vs to a more excellent ſtate, vnto the heauenly glorie.)</p>
               <p>And hereof commeth our Iuſtification, properly ſo called, that is to ſay, Gods cenſure and Iudgement of vs, approouing vs for holy and righteous before him, &amp; as hauing that Righteouſneſſe, that is able to abide his preſence. So as euen by the ſentence of God himſelfe, and in his moſt exact Iuſtice, we are freed, and abſolued, and declared righteous, and worthie of euerlaſting life: which is that the Scripture oppoſeth to the ſentence of condemnation, <hi>Rom. 8. 33, 34. Who ſhall lay accuſation to the Elect of God? It is God that iuſtifieth, who can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne?</hi> Thus the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, <hi>Rom. 5. 18.

               <p>This ſo noble a benefit commeth to bee wrought by the Reſurrection of Chriſt, as the Remiſſion of our ſinnes came by his death and ſufferings. So writeth the

               <p>From Iuſtification two things doe follow: Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,<note place="margin">from whence commeth San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification and Redemption.</note> and Redemption, or Holineſſe, and Bleſſedneſſe.

               <p>And as death before comprehended our ſinfull and curſed eſtate, whereunto theſe are contrarie: ſo the Scripture is wont to note them both in one word of Life euerlaſting begunne on Earth, and perfected in Heauen: for that the Righteouſneſſe of Chriſt made ours by Faith, is effectuall in vs vnto eternall Life, by the Spirit of CHRIST, who ſanctifieth and quickeneth vs.</p>

               <p>And to the end wee may know it muſt bee thorowly done, the Scripture not onely ſpeaketh of our dying vnto ſinne, but that the old man muſt bee <hi>buried</hi> alſo, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 4.</p>
               <p>This aboliſhing of our ſinfulneſſe or mortification of ſinne within vs, doth <hi>Paul</hi> aſcribe to the power of the death of Chriſt, when hee ſaith that

Whereas our Sanctification in this life is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uermore imperfect, fayling much, and hath alwaies ſin mixed with it, not as Chaffe or Darnell is mixed with Whear, but as water is mingled with wine, that there is no drop of wine, but it is water alſo: and that is by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon our new birth is imperfect. So that<note place="margin">Donatiſts, and Nouatians, and thoſe heretikes that were wont to bee called Cathariſes, or Puritanes, dreame of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie and perfection in this life.</note> albeit by the grace of Regeneration, we

                  <hi>that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not doe the things wee would.</hi> Whereof the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> (one, more then after an ordinarie ſort regenerate) gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth in his owne perſon a noble example, <hi>Rom. 7. 15, &amp;c. I approue not that I worke: for I doe not that I would, but what I hate, that doe I: for I am delighted with the Law of God, as touching the inner man, but I ſee another Law in my members, &amp;c.</hi> and in the end concludeth, <hi>Therfore I my ſelfe in the Spirit indeed ſerue the Law of God, but in my fleſh the Law of ſinne.</hi> Wherefore in this eſtate it is enough, if ſinne <note n="i" place="margin">Rom. 6. 12.</note> raigne not in our mortall bodies: it is not required (which is impoſſible) that it ſhould not at all dwell in vs.</p>

               <pb n="460" facs="tcp:29324:244"/>
               <p>Secondly, It is totall, in reſpect that it maketh a change, not in our
<note n="p" place="margin">Ier. 7. 3.</note> wayes and actions only, but in our very nature, the perfect and all-ſufficient Sanctification<note place="margin">Eſay 1. 16, 17.</note> of our nature, in the perſon of Chriſt himſelfe, freeing vs from that naturall corruption, which, as the Law of the members, is inherent in vs. This the Apoſtle ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, <hi>Romanes</hi>
                  <note n="q" place="margin">Rom. 8. 2.</note> the eighth, <hi>The Law of the Spirit of life, which is in Chriſt Ieſus, hath freed mee from the Law of ſin and of death:</hi> that is, from that inherent corruption, which, as the Law of the members, ſticketh to our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the perfect Sanctification of his humane nature be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning a Sanctification here in vs, euen in our very nature, ouer and beſides the Righteouſneſſe of our wayes.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, It is totall, in regard of both the parts of Righteouſneſſe which wee are renewed into, <hi>Holineſſe and true Iustice:</hi> for both theſe the Scripture noteth, <hi>Epheſ. 4. 24. Put on the new man, which according to God is created in Holineſſe and true Iuſtice. Marke 6. 20. Herod</hi> reuerenced IOHN BAPTIST, <hi>knowing he was a iuſt and a holy man. Luke 1. 74. That wee being deliuered from the hands of our enemies, may ſerue him in true Iuſtice and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe. Titus 2. 11, 12. The grace of God hath appeared, &amp;c. inſtructing vs to liue wiſely, and iuſtly, and godly in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent World.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet we muſt obſerue that there are degrees in the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection which we ſpeake of: for</p>
               <p>Firſt, Some are weake ones, and euen Babes in Chriſt, weake in Faith, weake in Knowledge, weake in all kind of practice of ſpirituall Graces, whom the Apoſtle cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth carnall, that is to ſay, rude. Of the weake in Faith, the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, <hi>Romanes</hi> 14. 1. And our Sauiour many times vpbraydeth his Diſciples, <hi>O yee of little faith!</hi> Of weake in knowledge, and capacitie of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly things, it is ſaid, <hi>Rom. 6. 19. I ſpake vnto you after the manner of men,</hi> that is, by Similitudes taken from the
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:29324:244"/> common courſe of mans life, <hi>For the infirmitie of your fleſh. And Heb. 5. 12. For when through the time, yee ought to haue beene Teachers, yea haue need to bee taught anew what are the elements of the beginning of the words of Chriſt, and are become thoſe that haue need of Milke, and not of ſtrong meate.</hi> So our Sauiour Chriſt telleth his Diſciples, <note n="r" place="margin">Iohn 16. 12.</note> 
                  <hi>I haue many things to ſay vnto you, but you are not able to beare them now.</hi> Of weake in practice we reade, 1. <hi>Cor. 3. 1. I, Brethren, could not ſpeake vnto you as ſpirituall, but as car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, as Infants in</hi> CHRIST; <hi>I gaue you Milke to drinke, and not ſtrong meate: for you were not able to beare it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, There is a further ſtep, which Chriſtians of the better ſort commonly attayne vnto, ſtanding in a ſufficient furniture of all graces needfull for the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of euery good dutie in ſoule, good manner, and a blameleſſe and vndefiled life, whereof the Scripture gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth teſtimonie to many particular Chriſtians: And the Apoſtles in their Epiſtles, partly <note n="ſ" place="margin">1. Cor. 1. 1. 1. Theſ. 5, &amp;c.</note> witneſſe of diuers Churches, and partly <note n="t" place="margin">Phil. 2. 15. 2. Pet. 3. 14, &amp;c.</note> pray for them to be ſuch.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Vpon ſome few, in reſpect of his ordinarie dealing, it pleaſeth GOD to powre a more aboundant meaſure of grace, and higher degree of perfection, fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and inriching their hearts with an exceeding in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of Faith, of Knowledge, of Loue, of Hope, of Patience, and of the Gifts of the Holy Ghoſt. Theſe the Apoſtle calleth <note n="u" place="margin">Heb. 5. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>perfect men, who through a habit haue their ſences exerciſed to the diſcerning of good and euill. Phil. 3. 15. As many of vs as are perfect, let vs bee thus minded and if ye thinke any thing otherwiſe, that alſo will God reueale.</hi> Thus <note n="x" place="margin">Rom. 4. 20, 21</note> it is ſaid of <hi>Abraham,</hi> that <hi>hee was ſtrong in Faith, and had full aſſurance of the promiſe of God.</hi> And of the <note n="y" place="margin">1. Theſ. 1. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> that <hi>their Faith did increaſe exceedingly,</hi> or aboue the common or ordinarie mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, <hi>and the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> did abound.</hi> In another
<note n="z" place="margin">1. Theſ. 1. 3.</note> place hee commendeth not onely the vertues themſelue<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, but the
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:29324:245"/> fruit which they ſhewed of them, <hi>Remembring the worke of your faith, your laborious loue, and patient hope, &amp;c.</hi> And the <note n="*" place="margin">Iames 5. 11.</note> Scripture ſetteth before vs the Patience of <hi>Iob,</hi> and the Vertues and Perfections of other men of God, as mirrours and glaſſes for vs to looke into, for the reforming of our wayes, and that we might become like vnto them.</p>
               <p>Not that ſuch a one hath attayned to perfection, or may now ſet downe and reſt, as being come to his iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies end, but the more graces he hath, the more fruitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he ought to labour for an increaſe of them, and not ſo much to thinke what hee hath; as what he doth yet want, following the example of the <note n="a" place="margin">Phil. 3. 13, 14, 15.</note> Apoſtle PAVL, <hi>Brethren, I count not that I haue attayned vnto the marke,</hi> that is to ſay, perfection. <hi>But one thing I doe, I forget that which is behind, and endeuour my ſelfe to that which is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. As many of vs therefore as are perfect, let vs bee thus minded.</hi> Wherein wee haue the
<note n="b" place="margin">Mat. 25. 29.</note> promiſe of our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Chriſt to giue vs comfort, that <hi>to him that hath,</hi> (that is, carefully imployeth and vſeth to Gods Glorie, the good things hee hath receiued) <hi>more ſhall bee giuen, and hee ſhall haue abundance.</hi> Our Sanctification being ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, as we haue ſaid, it is a noble and neceſſarie piece of ſeruice to informe our ſelues, how wee may bee able to diſcerne it. I will point out ſuch notes and markes as I hold to be the principall. Firſt is, by thoſe common affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions noted before, which generally belong to all holy Duties, and are heere certaine markes of renewed Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe:</p>
               <p>As firſt, A loue of the Truth, and of the Word <note n="c" place="margin">Iohn 17. 17. Thy Word is Truth.</note> for the Truths ſake: for <hi>to be of the Truth,</hi> that is, a louer and imbracer of the Truth, is all one as to <hi>be of God.</hi> And ſo our Sauiour Chriſt expoundeth it, when ſaying in <note n="d" place="margin">Iohn 18. 37.</note> one place, <hi>Euery one that is of the Truth, heareth my voyce,</hi> hee rendreth it in <note n="e" place="margin">Iohn 8. 47.</note> another place by this, as all one in waight and ſubſtance: <hi>Hee that is of God, heareth the
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:29324:245"/> words of God. O how I loue thy Law,</hi> (ſaith <note n="f" place="margin">Pſal. 119. 91.</note> DAVID!) <hi>All the day long it is my Meditation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The contrarie whereof, is an euident ſigne of an euill and wicked heart, and draweth after it many heauie Iudgements, fore-runners of deſtruction: for <note n="g" place="margin">2. Theſ. 2. 11, 12.</note> 
                  <hi>Becauſe</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>they receiue not the loue of the Truth, that they might be ſaued: therefore GOD will ſend vnto them effectuall errors to beleeue lyes, that all may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, that beleeue not the Truth, but take pleaſure in iniquitie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, Cheerefulneſſe in well-doing. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon the Children of God are euery-where called, <note n="h" place="margin">Pſal. 110. 3. Cant. 6. 9. &amp;c.</note> 
                  <hi>A free-hearted people.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, A feare of offending in any thing, which <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> maketh the Badge of Gods Children: <hi>Bleſſed is the man that feareth alwayes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, Sinceritie and ſingleneſſe of heart, which one thing, in the middeſt of many difficulties, held vp the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> inſomuch as he profeſſeth of himſelfe, <hi>This</hi> 
                  <note n="i" place="margin">2. Cor. 1. 12.</note> 
                  <hi>is our reioycing, the teſtimonie of our conſcience, that in ſingleneſſe and ſinceritie of God, we haue beene conuerſant in the World.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fiftly, Zeale: when not onely wee loue God, and his Truth, but our loue is hot, vehement, feruent, <hi>that</hi> 
                  <note n="k" place="margin">Cant. 7. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>much water cannot quench it, no, nor the flouds drowne it. And if a man ſhould giue all the ſubstance of his houſe for this loue, it ſhould vtterly be contemned.</hi> PHINEAS for this grace obtayned a great Mercie, <hi>Numb. 25. 12, 13. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore behold, I giue vnto him my Couenant of Peace: for he and his ſeed after him ſhall haue an euerlaſting Prieſthood by couenant, becauſe he was zealous for his God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sixtly, Watchfulneſſe ouer our wayes, which our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour ſo often doth beate vpon:
<note n="l" place="margin">Mat. 26. 14.</note>

               </p>
               <p>Seuenthly, A conſtant reſolution to cleaue vnſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly vnto Chriſt. So <hi>Acts</hi> 11. 23, 24. BA<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>Eightly, To performe whatſoeuer wee doe of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to God, <hi>Working it from the heart, as to the Lord, and not to man, Col.</hi> 3. 23.</p>
               <p>Ninthly, To ſeeke his glorie in all things: which generall rule the Apoſtle ſetteth downe, 1. <hi>Cor. 10. 31. Whether ye eat or drinke, or whatſoeuer ye doe, doe all to the glory of God.</hi>
               </p>

               </p>
               <p>The eleuenth and laſt (which yet is ſo farre from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing leaſt, that in a manner it carryeth the prayſe from all the reſt) is an entire obedience, when we labour to keepe whatſoeuer God hath commanded, and to pleaſe him in all things, being holy, as hee is holy, <hi>Ezechiel</hi> in his eighteenth Chapter in one word expreſſeth it, <hi>If he keepe all mine Ordinances:</hi> and then <note n="n" place="margin">Ezech. 18. 11, 12, &amp;c.</note> amplifying it by the contrarie, beateth vpon it (as his manner is) with a heape and multitude of inforcing ſpeeches, <hi>If he doe to his Brother, other then any one of thoſe things, and he do not all theſe things, &amp;c.</hi>

               <p>To come to ſome other notes of Sanctification, in the ſecond place many parts of Holineſſe are vndoubted ſignes of it.</p>
               <p>Firſt, our intercourſe with God by priuate and feruent Prayer of Faith, is the moſt infallible ſigne of all the reſt. A ſingular fruit and teſtimonie to a mans conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that hee is regenerate: for this is the very marke which the Holy Ghoſt ſetteth vpon prophane men, <hi>They</hi>

                  <hi>call not vpon God:</hi> and the reaſon is plaine and euident: for either Prayer will make men to leaue ſinne, or ſinne will make men to leaue to pray.</p>
               <p>The wicked, though they ſeeme to pray in ſecret, doe it ſeldome, or neuer, with companie to fill vp the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and for their credit ſake; or for ſome worldly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, they can be content to make one. But howſoeuer it bee, their Prayers differ farre from the properties of true Prayer, that are onely to bee found in Gods Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. Which properties, and wherein the wicked differ from them, may all be gathered out of that moſt abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Prayer both for matter and forme, which our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our himſelfe hath taught vs, and are theſe that follow,</p>

                  </note> 
                  <hi>Spirit of Prayer, or Supplication,</hi> that is, an excellent Grace, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie, or abilitie wrought in a man by the holy Spirit, whereby he is made able, willing, and readie to pray vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:29324:247"/> God for euery want, as the preſent occaſion doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire: for as the
<note n="z" place="margin">Rom. 8. 26.</note> Apoſtle ſaith, Of our ſelues <hi>we know not what to pray.</hi> Therefore our Sauiour deliuers vnto vs in few wordes, all the maine Graces wee can deſire, and maine wants we any way can ſtand in need of, to aske at the hands of God, which may ſerue for a Store-houſe, continually to put words in our mouth. But the carnall man, though he can ſpeake and tell a perſwaſiue Tale for worldly things, he is vtterly ignorant how to aske hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That we may pray as we ought, the <note n="a" place="margin">Rom. 8. 26, 27</note> Spirit helpeth our infirmitie, and teacheth vs to pray according vnto God, with grones and ſighes that cannot bee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed. But this the Worldling is farre from, to whom ſuch ſighes and gronings of the Spirit are as ſtrange and vnheard of, as is the <note n="b" place="margin">Iohn 14. 17.</note> Spirit it ſelfe the Authour of it.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Gods Children in all their neceſſities addreſſe themſelues to him, and ſeeke for good things at the hands of <hi>their heauenly Father</hi> through Chriſt; the wicked howſoeuer with <note n="c" place="margin">Numb. 23. 14</note> 
                  <hi>Balaam</hi> they may breake forth into wiſhes and woulds, <hi>Let my ſoule dye the death of the Righteous, and my latter end be like to him;</hi> haue neither the face nor the heart to goe to God by humble Prayer, as <hi>Dauid</hi> in the like caſe did, <hi>Pſal. 26. 9. Take not away my ſoule with ſinners, nor my life with bloudie men.</hi> This diuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie you may finde, <hi>Pſal. 4. 7. Many ſay, Who will ſhew vs good?</hi> IEHOVAH, <hi>lift vp vpon vs the light of thy coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, The godly prepare themſelues to Prayer, by <note n="d" place="margin">Eccleſ. 4. 13.</note> meditating before-hand of the dutie they are to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme, and of the arguments and reaſons that may ſtirre them vp vnto it. And ſo our Sauiour in that Prayer tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth vs to doe, by the vſing of a Preface. The wicked neuer make conſcience of their Prayers.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, True Prayer cannot be without Faith, whereby
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:29324:247"/> wee apply particularly to our ſelues, the loue of GOD in Chriſt, to call him <hi>Our Father:</hi> for <hi>how ſhall they call on him, in whom they doe not beleeue? Rom.</hi> 10. 14. but this the carnall man hath not.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, Gods Children come with boldneſſe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence vnto him, as a Child vnto his Father; whereas the carnall man flyeth from him, and is afraid of him, as of a Iuſt and Righteous Iudge. This difference in the point of Prayer the Apoſtle teacheth, <hi>Rom. 8. 15. Wee haue not receiued the Spirit of bondage, to feare any more: but the Spirit of Adoption, whereby we cry, Abba Father.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Seuenthly, Reuerence is in the true and faithfull Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler vpon of Gods Name,
<note n="e" place="margin">Eccleſ. 5. 1.</note> knowing that God is in <hi>Heauen,</hi> and himſelfe vpon Earth: the carnall man ruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth without all reuerence into his preſence.</p>
               <p>Eightly, Our Sauiour requireth of his, Zeale and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtneſſe in Prayer, that all our affections bee taken vp, and wholly bent vpon it, which the ſhortneſſe of the Prayer teacheth, and the concluding of it with this word, <hi>Amen:</hi> and the rather to kindle in vs a feruencie in Prayer, he beateth vpon it with many words: <note n="f" place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>.</note> 
                  <hi>Aske, Seeke, Knocke, &amp;c.</hi> For cold Suiters prooue cold Spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders: But ſuch as euen rent the Heauens with their Prayers, and pull, as it were by violence, Gods Graces from him, are thoſe that hee delighteth in: but this the carnall man is farre from, whoſe minde is alwayes ſtrag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and thinketh vpon his penny, his buſineſſe and worldly delights.</p>
               <p>Ninthly, In Gods Children there is a greater feruen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of Spirit, in praying for the things that concerne Gods glorie, then for thoſe that concerne our owne good, yea though it be the ſaluation of our ſoules; and in thoſe that concerne our owne good, greater zeale, and feruencie for heauenly things, then for earthly, that are ſought but as additaments, and appendances to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; all which, the very order of petitioning in the
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:29324:248"/> Lords Prayer ſheweth. Contrariwiſe, of theſe, world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things are altogether, or (at the leaſt) moſt ſought after.</p>
               <p>Tenthly, The godly pray, to ſet forth Gods glory, as may be ſeene there: The
<note n="g" place="margin">Iames 4. 3.</note> wicked aske, to imploy it vpon their luſts.</p>
               <p>Eleuenthly, Gods Children in their prayers remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber not themſelues onely, but the Church, their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren and fellow-members, in a fellow-feeling and loue one of another: <hi>Our Father, Our bread, Our treſpaſſes, Lead vs not, Deliuer vs, &amp;c.</hi> The wicked are euery one for himſelfe.</p>
               <p>Twelfthly, The Elect pray with aſſurance of obtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the things; wee pray for earthly things, with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, ſo farre as God hath appointed them for our good: All other abſolutely without condition: which aſſurance is noted in the word <hi>Amen,</hi> ſignifying, that not only ſo we deſire it may be, but that ſo vndoubtedly it is, and ſhall be: whereunto wee are induced both by the conſideration of the loue of God, who is <hi>our Father,</hi> and therefore willing; and of his power, <hi>which is in heauen,</hi> and therefore able to doe vs good. Which two, (his Goodneſſe, and his Greatneſſe) are the two maine pillars and props of our Faith. And to this vertue in prayer, our Sauiour doth exhort vs, <hi>Mark. 11. 24. All things, whatſoeuer yee aske when yee pray, beleeue yee ſhall receiue them, and they ſhall be yours.</hi> The wicked are as<note n="h" place="margin">Iames 1. 6.</note> waues of the Sea toſſed about with euery wind, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and diſtruſting of Gods goodneſſe in the things they pray for.</p>
               <p>Thirteenth, Gods Children are conſtant in their prayers, and continue in them, <hi>Giue vs this day, &amp;c.</hi> eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day renewing their ſupplications. The wicked faint and quickly giue ouer, or pray but by ſtarts.</p>
               <p>Theſe circumſtances to be obſerued out of the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the Lords Prayer, lead mee by the hand to ſome
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:29324:248"/> conſideration of the matter it ſelfe, and parts of that Prayer; wherein alſo, vnleſſe I deceiue may ſelfe, we ſhall nothing digreſſe from our purpoſe.</p>
               <p>There be two parts of that, as of all other Prayers: for it ſtandeth partly in petition, partly, in thankeſ-gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing: The Petitions are ſixe in number, all in that courſe and order, as the Doctrine before was handled, whereof the firſt three (comprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded in the firſt part of Diuinity) are of thoſe things that belong vnto Gods glory, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any reſpect of our owne good: as the particle <hi>Thy</hi> in euery one doth ſhew. And this one thing, wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eein the ſoundeſt Diuines agree, being well obſerued, bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a great light for the diſtinguiſhing of all the ſixe Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions, according to their proper bounds and limits, in ſuch ſort as hereafter followeth:</p>
               <p>The firſt Peticion, <hi>Hallowed bee thy name:</hi> O thou the bleſſed and great IEHOVAH, <hi>Father, Sonne, and holy Spirit,</hi> three perſons, and one onely true and euer-liuing God, whoſe <note n="i" place="margin">Eſay 9. 3.</note> name is wonderfull, and who alone art glorious and excellent: thy Mercie great vnto the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens, thy Truth vnto the Cloudes: thy Righteouſneſſe as the mightie Hills; thy Iudgements like the bottom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe Deepe: exalt thy ſelfe, O God, aboue the heauens, thy Glorie ouer all the earth.</p>
               <p>And make it knowne vnto thy creatures, that thou the Creator (bleſſed for euer, <hi>Amen</hi>) art a Nature Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall and Diuine, of thy ſelfe, and in thy ſelfe, and by thy ſelfe ſubſiſting, Eternall, Immeaſurable, Incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſible, Infinite<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in Power, Wiſdome, Holineſſe, Truth, Mercie, Iuſtice, and whatſoeuer good is, yea, Goodneſſe and Perfection it ſelfe: So that both whatſoeuer thou doeſt, is abſolutely good and holy, and all good and perfect gifts are thine, there being no iot of good in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny creature, but that onely which they haue from thee who art the Father of Lights.</p>
               <p>And this reſpecteth the firſt branch of that part of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinitie,
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:29324:249"/> concerning the Nature, Perſons, and Properties of the Godhead.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Petition, <hi>Thy Kingdome come.</hi> Aduance the Throne and Scepter of thy Kingdome in the Gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the World, according to all thy counſels and purpoſes decreed from Eternitie.</p>
               <p>Whether of ſauing the Elect, or deſtroying of the Reprobate, or of the buſineſſes and affaires pertayning to this life, and the generall Prouidence ouer all things that thy hands haue faſhioned and made, together with the meanes which thou haſt ſanctified thereunto, thy Goſpell, with the Miniſterie and preaching thereof, the Sacraments, Cenſures, and Diſcipline of the Church, and all other good things thou haſt ordayned, may prooue to thy Children a ſauour of life vnto life, and to none of them a ſauour of death vnto death.</p>
               <p>And that thou wouldeſt ſo diſpoſe of things by thy hidden and ſecret prouidence, that all perſons and crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures (although they, many of them ſinfully and wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chedly mooued with other cauſes and ends, then in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience vnto thee, yet in regard of thy worke moſt holily and iuſtly) may concurre to doe whatſoeuer thy hand and thy counſell hath fore-determined to be done. Neither let any power or policie of Satan or man, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other creature hinder the execution of thy moſt glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and magnificent, moſt wiſe and iuſt Decrees: But let them all bee as the Mountaines of Braſſe that cannot be remooued, but ſtand faſt for euer.</p>
               <p>And this reſpecteth the ſecond branch, touching the Kingdome of God, and the diſpenſation of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels.</p>
               <p>The third Petition: <hi>Thy will be done in Earth, as it is in Heauen.</hi> Haue thou alwayes in the World, euen here a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men, as thou haſt among thy holy Angels and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of the Righteous that are deceaſed, a Church and choſen Companie, which may <note n="k" place="margin">Zach. 8. 8.</note> refreſh and delight
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:29324:249"/> thy Spirit, by yeelding with free and readie hearts, all cheerfull obedience to thy knowne and reuealed will, whileſt they bee ſeene to preferre the loue they beare to thee, before the loue of themſelues, their owne pleaſure, profit, or liues, or whatſoeuer elſe that is moſt deare vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them.</p>
               <p>And this which is the third branch (the honour due to God) riſeth by a neceſſarie conſequence from the former two: for he that is in himſelfe and in his workes ſo glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, is worthie, and alone worthy to be honoured and ſerued of vs.</p>
               <p>The three latter Petitions comprehended in the ſecond part of Diuinitie, are of thoſe things that concerne our owne and our Neighbours good, whereof the firſt (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the fourth Petition in number) is for the Fountaine of all good, that excellent <note n="l" place="margin">Iohn 4. 4.</note> gift of Chriſt himſelfe, and all the meanes, and Graces, Faith eſpecially, whereby he may be ours, and we come to be his.</p>
               <p>The fift and ſixt are for the ſtreames of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe that flow from it, and ſpring vnto euerlaſting life: So that in theſe laſt Petitions the whole ſubſtance of the Goſpell is contayned: for touching the other Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe which is our owne, or by the Law, the ſame being impoſſible through our owne corruption to be had, our Sauiour teacheth vs not to pray for it. But contrariwiſe, in teaching Regeneration and Righteouſneſſe through him, he doth vtterly exclude all Righteouſneſſe from our ſelues, or by our owne Creation.</p>
               <p>And in willing vs to pray to bee deliuered from euill, he ſheweth the right vſe of the Law, whereby euill is diſcouered to be the rule of our obedience.</p>
               <p>The fourth Petition: <hi>Giue vs this Day that Bread of ours, that</hi> (bread) <hi>aboue ſubſtance,</hi> or better then all wealth and riches which conſume and periſh, whereas this indureth to euerlaſting Life, being the Bread of God that commeth downe from Heauen, and giueth life

Hale and pull vs, as a beaſt that ſticketh in the myre, out of the miſerable condition whereinto ſinne hath plunged vs, the curſe of the Law, Hell, Death, and Condemnation; and from him that hath the power of death, that is to ſay, the Deuill. So make vs happie and bleſſed, through the communion of the Bleſſednes which is in thee, that euen now in ſome meaſure we may haue our part in all, and ſo much as is able to fall into this life: where the teſtimonie and aſſurance of thy loue, and the hauing and inioying (in and from thy loue) of all the good things of this preſent life, both for neceſſitie and Chriſtian Delight, Maintenance, Health, Credit, Friends, Comfort of Wife, Children, Seruants, a Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing vpon our Labours, the fruit of Magiſtracie and of Gouernment, and good order in the World, together with the ſanctifying of all things, euen our very trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles and croſſes of this life, vnto our good, ſo as thou in thy Mercie haſt appointed for vs, Peace of conſcience and Ioy in the Holy Ghoſt, doe excell: and by theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, as it were by ſo many ſteps and ſtayres make vs to climbe vp to that perfect and eternall Happineſſe, which is reſerued for thy Saints in Heauen, when Hell, Satan, ſinne, weakneſſe, ſhame trodden vnder foot, we ſhall be all ſpirituall and glorious, and raigne as Kings with thee for euermore.</p>
               <p>Wherefore here is ſet before vs, that in eſtimable be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit we receiue by Chriſt, which comming laſt, crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the reſt, and in the lauding <note n="o" place="margin">Reuel. 5. 8, 9. 10, 11, 12, 13.</note> and magnifying whereof, all Eternitie ſhall bee ſpent, the full and finall Redemption of our ſoules and bodies, vnto the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Inheritance purchaſed for the ſonnes of God.</p>
               <p>Whereupon, after the Petitions ended, followeth Prayſe and Thankeſgiuing vnto God, the Fountaine of all good, in theſe words: <hi>For thine is the Kingdome, the power, and the glorie, for euer and euer:</hi> that is to ſay, all abſolute and perfect Bleſſedneſſe, both for thy might
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:29324:252"/> and Soueraigntie of commanding all things, being all thy creatures, and the worke of thy hands: and for the power of effecting whatſoeuer thou wilt and doeſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand: and laſtly, in regard of the infinite Graces that ſhine ſo gloriouſly in thy perſon, and which thou doeſt ſo graciouſly extend to vs: being thy ſelfe eternall, and therefore exerciſing an eternall power and dominion in the World; not onely confounding thoſe whome thou haſt appointed to deſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the praiſe of thy glorious Iuſtice: but (which is principally here conſidered) crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting anew an eternall people to thy ſelfe, to the prayſe of thy glorious Grace.</p>
               <p>Hauing thus finiſhed the Lords Prayer, becauſe the ſence which I gaue of the fourth Petition may ſeeme new (though it cannot bee called new, which a number of the Fathers doe ſo expound) yet for the better ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of the godly Reader, let mee ſhortly render my reaſons for it:</p>
               <p>Firſt, I hold this Prayer to bee a compendiarie ſumme of all the holy Doctrine concerning God and our Saluation in Chriſt: wherein it cannot bee thought, that he himſelfe and our incorporating into him (the roote and baſes of all good things wee haue from him) ſhould be omitted, being that which he ſo preſſeth vs to ſeeke, and giueth the firſt place vnto in all his Doctrines, <hi>Iohn 3. 3. Iohn</hi> 4. and <hi>Iohn</hi> 6. which Chapter may ſerue for a Commentarie vpon this place.</p>
               <p>Secondly; The method and order of the Petitions were not ſo naturall, to aske earthly benefits before hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly Bleſſings.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the Analogie and correſpondence of theſe latter Petitions with the former three, for as they begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning with the great and glorious Name of God, fall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards to his adioynts of Kingdome, and Honour: ſo theſe beginne with Chriſt and Regeneration through him, the fruits whereof are Iuſtification and Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:29324:252"/> which follow in their place: as the Apoſtle, agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly hereunto reduceth the benefits we haue by Chriſt, to theſe three heads, &amp; that in the ſame order: Regeneratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the root &amp; mother of the reſt: Iuſtification and Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, the two twinnes and noble payre that commeth from it, 1. <hi>Ioh. 5. 8. There be three that beare record in Earth,</hi> to the Soule and Conſcience of euery true Beleeuer: <hi>The Spirit, or</hi> part regenerate: <hi>Water,</hi> whereby wee are waſhed and clenſed from our ſinne: and <hi>Bloud,</hi> purging and aboliſhing both the roote and fruites of it; which is attributed to the bloud of Chriſt, <hi>Heb. 9. 14. 1. Iohn</hi> 1. 7, 9 And that is ſo to bee taken in this place, not for expiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I gather, by that the Apoſtle <note n="p" place="margin">1. Iohn 5. 6.</note> ſaid before, <hi>This is he that came by Water and Bloud,</hi> that is to ſay, not our Iuſtifier only, which all men doe willingly imbrace: but to ſanctifie vs alſo, which men will not ſo eaſily bee brought vnto.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Seeing it is plaine, that by obtayning par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don for our ſinnes, and Righteouſneſſe in Chriſt (which is asked in the fift Petition) conſequently wee haue all the Bleſſedneſſe that belongeth to it, one part whereof is this, to haue all outward things, as additaments and appendances caſt vnto vs, ſo farre as God hath appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them for our good, as our Sauiour Chriſts both ſpeech and promiſe is, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 33. and further then that, wee haue no warrant to deſire them; it ſeemeth not ſo likely, that either our Sauiour Chriſt would rent theſe things a ſunder, and tranſplant one from another, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to ſet the fruit before the branch that beareth it, or in ſo ſhort a ſumme admit of repetition, which muſt needs follow, if being elſe-where included, wee aske them here by name. And this alſo may ſerue to prooue, that no defect or maime can iuſtly be imputed to this ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute forme of Prayer, though outward things come not within compaſſe of the fourth Petition.</p>

               <p>For firſt, the conſideration of this, that God is the Authour of all iudgements, hath a ſingular vſe for the quieting of our mindes in the ſtormes and tempeſts of afflictions: for whether the ſame come immediately from God, without the hand of man, wee are to remember him that ſaid, <note n="t" place="margin">Pſal. 39. 10.</note>

               </p>
               <p>Satans brood I call the World and the Fleſh:</p>
               <p>By World, meaning,</p>
               <p>Firſt, The malignant Church, the companie of the wicked and vngodly, <hi>The ſonnes of that naughtie one,</hi> as they are termed, <hi>Mat. 13. 38. For</hi>

                  <hi>becauſe wee are not of the World, but GOD hath choſen vs out of the World, therefore doth the World hate vs,</hi> which is the perpetuall ſtate of Gods Church from the beginning, and was fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gured in <note n="m" place="margin">Ge. 25. 22, 23</note> 
                  <hi>Rebecca,</hi> a Type of the Church, in whoſe wombe were two Nations deuided that ſtroue and fought together. And our Sauiour doth fore-warne vs not to looke for better: <hi>In</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Secondly, Whatſoeuer is vnregenerate in the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God themſelues, whereby it many times falleth out, that none are greater inſtruments vnto vs of offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding God then they. By the fleſh, I meane, our naturall corruption, and all the luſts and workes of it: an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie which we alwayes carrie about vs, not onely in our boſome, but in our very bowels: So that heere is the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell between the fleſh &amp; the Spirit, wherof the <note n="o" place="margin">Gal. 5. 17.</note> Apoſtle ſaith, that <hi>the fleſh luſteth againſt the Spirit, and the Spirit againſt the fleſh: And theſe,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>are oppoſite one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.

               </p>
               <p>Secondly, In this conflict are to be conſidered the two Generals of theſe Battels.</p>
               <p>The Captaine vnder whome wee fight, IESVS, <hi>the</hi> 
                  <note n="u" place="margin">Heb. 12. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>Prince and perfiter of our Faith,</hi> in <note n="x" place="margin">Gen. 3. 15.</note> 
                  <hi>Geneſis</hi> pointed out by <hi>the ſeed of the woman,</hi> to note his Manhood: in the
<note n="y" place="margin">Reuel. 12. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>Reuelation,</hi> by <hi>Michael,</hi> equall with the mightie God, to ſet forth his God-head: you ſhall find him roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally deſcribed, <hi>Reuel.</hi> 19. 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16. The head and generall lifted vp againſt him, is the Dragon, the old Serpent, Satan or the Deuill, as wee heard before.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The weapons of this Warfare, both thoſe which our Aduerſaries the Fleſh, the World, and the Deuill fight withall, and thoſe whereby wee doe reſiſt them.</p>
               <p>The weapon of ſinne, or of the fleſh, is Luſt, as it is ſaid, <hi>Rom. 7. 8. Sinne taking occaſion by the Law, wrought in me all manner of luſt. Gal. 5. 17. The fleſh lusteth againſt the Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The weapons of the World, are,</p>
               <p>Firſt, Outward Afflictions and Perſecutions, Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, Slanders, &amp;c. to draw vs from Chriſt, <hi>Iohn 16. 33. In the World ye ſhall haue afflictions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, Eaſe, Credit, Pleaſure, Profit, Honour, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Euill Examples.</p>
               <p>Satans weapons are outward or inward: Outward,</p>
               <p>Firſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The World: for wicked men are the Hel-hounds of Satan, the Champions and Souldiers which hee fights withall, whoſe head and generall hee is, and therefore called the
<note n="z" place="margin">Iohn 14. 30. and 16. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>prince of this World</hi> (which name is giuen
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:29324:259"/> to all <note n="a" place="margin">Epheſ. 6. 12.</note> vncleane ſpirits) <hi>The</hi> 
                  <note n="b" place="margin">2. Cor. 4. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>god of this World.</hi> And the afflictions of the World, as they proceed from him, are called, <hi>The</hi>
                  <note n="c" place="margin">2. Co. 12. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>buffetings of Satan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, The obiects of ſinne to our eyes, our eares, and other ſences, which Satan ſetteth before vs, to draw vs to a loue, and in loue, to a committing of it, as hee did to our firſt Parents in Paradiſe, and to our <note n="d" place="margin">Mat. 4.</note> Sauiour Chriſt in the Wilderneſſe, and as hee ceaſeth not conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually to doe to vs.</p>
               <p>Inward ones are,</p>
               <p>Firſt, His kindling of the fire of our owne concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcence, blowing as it were the bellowes, and gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring together matter for it to worke vpon.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Temptations or Illuſions, which he caſteth into hearts, as Venome or Poyſon for to infect vs.</p>
               <p>Our weapons whereby wee doe reſiſt them, what they are, the Apoſtle notably declareth, 2. <hi>Cor. 10. 4. not car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, but mightie and valiant, to the throwing downe of all the ſtrong holds of ſinne.</hi> Where, though he ſpeake ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally of the Miniſters, yet the like is to bee ſaid (in their degree and place) of all other Chriſtians. Generally, it is the Word of God, as appeareth, 2. <hi>Theſſ. 2. 8. Whom God will conſume with the breath of his mouth.</hi> But more particularly they may be reduced vnto two heads, Faith and the fruits of Sanctification that come from it: for ſo <note n="e" place="margin">1. Tim. 1. 18.</note> 
                  <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy,</hi> vnder theſe two, comprehendeth all, willing him to fight that good Fight, <hi>hauing faith and a good conſcience.</hi> And 1. <hi>Theſſ. 5. 8. Put on the Breſt-plate of Faith, and Loue, and for a Helmet, the hope of Saluation.</hi> And 1. <hi>Cor. 16. 13, 14. Watch, ſtand in the Faith: Let all your things bee done in loue.</hi> In the
<note n="f" place="margin">Reuel. 12. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>Reuelation,</hi> they are reckoned theſe three (which come all vnder the other two) <hi>Faith in the bloud of the Lambe,</hi> as the Shield, the Sword of <hi>the Word of God, and confeſſion</hi> of Chriſt, vnto the death. Of Faith the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, 1. <hi>Pe. 5. 9. Whom</hi> (that is the Deuill) <hi>reſiſt ſtedfaſt in Faith.</hi> And 1. <hi>Iohn</hi> 5. 4, 5
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:29324:260"/> 
                  <hi>This is the victorie that ouercommeth the World, euen your Faith.</hi> And this as our chiefe and principall weapon, the Apoſtle biddeth vs <hi>aboue all,</hi> to take vnto vs, by it ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing Chriſt himſelfe, and his Spirit to bee ours. And therefore being that,
<note n="g" place="margin">Epheſ. 6. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>whereby we are able to quench the fiery darts of the Deuill.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The fruits of Sanctification, are all the Chriſtian Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues and Qualities which the Word of God requireth. The Apoſtle, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6. reckoneth them vp in this order:</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Truth,</hi> or a ſound and ſincere heart wrought by the Goſpell, which is the Word of Truth, as a belt to gird vs in.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Righteouſnes;</hi> both Piety and Iuſtice in a Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines towards God, &amp; Innocencie towards our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, for a Breſt-plate, the habit and perfection wherof being Loue
<note n="h" place="margin">1. Tim. 1. 5.</note> out of Faith vnfained. The Apoſtle therfore 1. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5. 8. calleth it <hi>The Breſt-plate of Faith and Loue.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Preparation,</hi> or readineſſe of minde, which is, as it were, the ſhooing of our feet, to make them light and nimble; and is another gracious effect of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell of Peace, which bringing the glad tydings of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation vnto God, maketh our Conſciences ſecure and at Peace in all our Combats, and ſo giueth vs a ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full paſſage thorow the middeſt of the Millions of ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies which we are to paſſe.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>Faith</hi> for our Shield, to hold out the Darts of Satan.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, <hi>Saluation,</hi> or the aſſured hope of Saluation (as it is ſaid in
<note n="i" place="margin">1. Theſſ. 5. 8.</note> another place) that is, of ſafetie and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerance reached out vnto vs from <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> for a Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, and laſtly, <hi>The Word of God,</hi> or the knowledge of the Scriptures, which are the Spirituall Sword, to cut aſunder all things that oppoſe themſelues vnto vs. Thus the Apoſtle ſetteth forth the complete Harneſſe of a Chriſtian Souldier, according to ſuch furniture as then
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:29324:260"/> they vſed, vnto the which he elſe-where addeth certaine other Tackling &amp; Harneſſe, namely, <hi>Prayer, Watchfulneſſe, Perſeuerance, Patience,</hi> and ſuch like, <hi>Epheſ. 6. 18. withall Prayer and Supplication, praying continually in the Spirit, and thereunto watching with all perſeuerance and ſupplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, &amp;c. Heb. 12. 4. With patience let vs runne the Race that is ſet before vs.</hi> And againe,
<note n="k" place="margin">Heb. 10. 3, 6.</note> 
                  <hi>For yee haue need of patience, that doing the will of God, ye may receiue the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The fourth thing in this Conflict, is the Goale or Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie we fight for, to wit, the maintenance and increaſe of Faith and Sanctification, which we ſtriue to vphold, Satan with all his forces for to ſhake, eſpecially, ſtriking at our Holineſſe of life, that ſo he may wound our Faith: Therefore <hi>Paul</hi> boaſteth of his keeping of the Faith, as of his winning of the Goale, for that ſtanding, we ſhall neuer fall: <hi>I haue</hi> 
                  <note n="l" place="margin">2. Tim. 4. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>fought that good fight, I haue finiſhed the courſe, I haue kept the Faith: from henceforth there is layd vp for me a Crowne of Righteouſneſſe, which God, that righteous Iudge ſhall render vnto me in that Day.</hi> And Chriſt vnto
<note n="m" place="margin">Luke 22. 32.</note> PETER, <hi>I haue prayed for thee, that thy Faith ſhould not faile.</hi> PAVL alſo exhorteth the <hi>Philippians,</hi> 
                  <note n="n" place="margin">Phil. 1. 27.</note> 
                  <hi>Wreſtle for the Faith of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Gospell, 1. Tim. 6. 12. Fight the good Fight of Faith,</hi> or for the Faith; as <hi>Iude</hi> 
                  <note n="o" place="margin">Iude verſe 3.</note> exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth thoſe to whom he writes, <hi>to ſtriue for the Faith once</hi> (for all, neuer to be loſt) <hi>deliuered to the Saints.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He ſtriketh at our Holineſſe or Sanctification of life, <hi>by prouoking to vs ſin,</hi> as occaſion is offered, or our owne diſpoſition doth moſt incline: in regard whereof hee is called, <hi>The</hi> 
                  <note n="p" place="margin">Mat. 4. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>Tempter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the effecting of it, two ſlights he vſeth;</p>
               <p>Firſt, Leſſening of ſinnes which men goe about to commit, to make them ſeeme but light.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Bringing men aſleepe with a preſumption of Gods Mercies.</p>
               <p>This temptation we are to reſiſt:</p>
               <pb n="494" facs="tcp:29324:261"/>
               <p>Firſt, By a ſerious meditation of the Law of GOD, condemning all ſinne, and teaching vs what is his good and acceptable will.</p>
               <p>Secondly, By conſideration of the Iudgements of God, and of the puniſhment due to ſinne.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, By calling to minde the loue of GOD in Chriſt, and the end of our Redemption, which is, <hi>that being deliuered out of the hand of all our foes, we might ſerue him in Holineſſe and Righteouſneſſe all the dayes of our life, Luke</hi> 1. 74. 75 Our Faith he doth aſſault, by labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to bring vs vnto deſpayre for our ſins committed.</p>
               <p>His ſlights to worke it, are likewiſe two:</p>
               <p>Firſt, Aggrauating of our offences, to make them ſeeme vnpardonable.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Terrifying the offender with Gods Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; both which wee are to reſiſt by the Meditation of the ſweet promiſes made, without exception vnto all that repent, and beleeue the Goſpell.</p>
               <p>Of theſe temptations, end there will bee none: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in them al we muſt take heed we neuer be ſecure; one temptation is to be looked for after another: for our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie neuer is at reſt, 1 <hi>Pe.</hi> 5. 8. And ſo we <note n="q" place="margin">Luke 5. 13.</note> reade of Chriſt himſelfe, that when the Deuill departed from him, (after he had tempted him all he could) it was but for a while.</p>
               <p>The firſt and laſt thing is the iſſue of all this Conflict, that howſoeuer by the violent ſtormes and tempeſts of temptations, our Faith and Holineſſe may before batte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and ſhaken, yet neuer it can bee loſt; but like the Cammomill, the more it is trodden downe, the more it riſeth vp: and as a mightie fire, that many pailes of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are throwne vpon, or other engines and deuices vſed to ſmother and keepe it downe, at the laſt to burſteth out againe, and flameth more then it did before. Wherefore this muſt make vs to fight couragiouſly, becauſe wee are aſſured of the victorie: for wee fight not by our owne ſtrength, but in the ſtrength of him who hath ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:29324:261"/> for vs: And therefore in his laſt farewell, biddeth vs <hi>Be</hi>
                  <note n="r" place="margin">Iohn 16. 33.</note> 
                  <hi>of good comfort,</hi> or take good heart vnto you, <hi>I haue ouercome the World.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wee come now vnto Repentance, which I make to follow vpon the former, becauſe of the many falls and foiles that we receiue at the hands of Satan in this our ſpiritual Conflict: out of the which we are to riſe by true Repentance: ſpeaking of Repentance heere, as it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth from a man renewed, not of the firſt worke of our conuerſion vnto God: for Repentance in generall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehendeth the whole <note n="ſ" place="margin">Marke 1. 4.</note> worke of Sanctification: but there is a ſpeciall Repentance of our euery dayes ſlips and fals, which onely hath place in a man Regenerate: for to him that is come ſo farre, there is no further need of that firſt kind of Repentance, ſeeing it is impoſſible that the Grace of Regeneration once begunne, ſhould at any time be loſt altogether. So I vnderſtand that which is ſpoken, <hi>Luke 15. 7. of righteous men that need no Repentance.</hi> Yet in truth there is but one Repentance, as there is but one Faith: But that Repentance begunne by Faith, is conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued all our life, practiſed and profeſſed day by day more or leſſe, according to the nature of our ſeuerall and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular ſinnes.</p>
               <p>This Repentance<note place="margin">
                     <p>The Papiſts make three parts of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, Confeſſion, Contrition, Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.</p>
                     <p>Confeſſion (which they will haue to be made in the Prieſts eare, and call Auri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular) is vaine, becauſe</p>

                  </note> therefore, or pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:29324:262"/> of Repentance, I call, A continuall ſorrow for our ſinnes, and a purpoſe to reſiſt againſt them: for ſorrow &amp; a griefe for ſinne committed, is one ſpeciall part of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, whereof the whole many times doth take the name, 1. <hi>Cor. 10. 7. The ſorrow which is according vnto God, worketh a change of mind vnto ſaluation, neuer to bee repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of:</hi> where both theſe parts, as you ſee, are compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended.</p>
               <p>Six things are to be noted in true Repentance.</p>
               <p>Firſt, The notes or ſignes of Repentance: the Apoſtle, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 11. reckoneth theſe ſeuen.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Studie,</hi> or diligence to rouze our ſelues out of ſleepe and ſecuritie of ſinne.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>A defence,</hi> excuſe or cleering of our ſelues, not by ſtanding in it, as if we had done well, or making leſſe of it, then the qualitie of the offence deſerueth, but asking pardon for our fault, in that we did it not wilfully and with malice, but of frailty and infirmity, and that ſo, as none more then we are offended therewithall. A no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table example whereof wee haue in that Confeſſion of the Church, <hi>Cant. 5. 1. I ſlept, but my heart waked.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Indignation,</hi> or an holy anger againſt our ſelues for it.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>A feare</hi> leſt wee ſhould fall againe into the like.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, <hi>A longing</hi> to bee deliuered from the bodie of ſinne, and to be made perfect.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, Zeale to God and to all goodneſſe.</p>
               <p>Seuenthly, <hi>Reuenge,</hi> by taming and chaſtizing the fleſh, and taking as it were our penniworths of it, that we runne not into the like hereafter: And therefore both forbearing lawfull things, that wee may the better ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtayne from vnlawfull, and flying leſſer ſinnes, leſt wee fall into greater, and all thoſe things that haue beene the meanes to lead vs vnto ſinne before.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is the fruit of this Repentance: A reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:29324:262"/> of vs vnto the former good eſtate, from the which, through frailtie wee are falne. So ſaith ELIHV, <hi>Iob 33. 25, 26. His fleſh is ſoftened more then in his childhood, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turneth to the dayes of his youth, when hee doth humbly pray to God, he doth accept him ſo, as hee beholdeth his face with reioycing, and he restroreth a man to his Righteouſneſſe.</hi> And <hi>Dauid,</hi> after his great fall, prayeth,
<note n="t" place="margin">Pſal. 51. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>Reſtore vnto mee the ioy of thy Saluation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, What ſinnes true Repentance doth free vs from. All, without exception, how great ſoeuer, and how many ſoeuer the ſame bee, ſecret, knowne, wilfull, or whatſoeuer elſe, except that one ſinne againſt the Holy Ghoſt, which none of the faithfull can fall into, nor can be repented of: for the multitude of our ſinnes is not to be compared with the Infiniteneſſe of GODS Merits, but is infinitely ſurpaſſed and ouercome of it, <hi>Eſay 1. 18. If your ſinne were as Scarlet double dyed, they ſhall be as white as Snow: if they were as red as Purple, they ſhall be made like vnto the Wooll: for my thoughts</hi> (ſaith the Lord) <hi>Eſay 55. 8, 9. are not as your thoughts, nor my wayes as your wayes</hi> (my thoughts and wayes of mercie and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giueneſſe, as your thoughts and wayes of wickedneſſe: they are too baſe and ſhallow to bee compared to them) <hi>but as the Heauens are higher then the Earth, ſo</hi> (and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely more) <hi>are my wayes higher then your wayes, and my thoughts aboue your thoughts.</hi> DAVID, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103. 10, 11 hath the like compariſon: <hi>Hee dealeth not with vs accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to our ſinnes, nor requiteth vs according to our iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: but as high as the Heauens are aboue the Earth, doth his kindneſſe preuaile towards them that feare him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, That Repentance is not in our owne power, when wee are once renewed, but it is the ſpeciall worke and Grace of God, to touch our hearts, being falne as it was at the firſt to quicken our ſoules. Therefore it is the Prayer of <hi>Ephraim,</hi> that is, of the Church of GOD, <note n="u" place="margin">
                     <hi>Ier.</hi> 31. 18.</note> 
                  <hi>Conuert thou me, that I may be conuerted.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="498" facs="tcp:29324:263"/>
               <p>And in the <note n="x" place="margin">Lam 5. 21.</note> 
                  <hi>Lamentations, Turne thou vs vnto thee, O</hi> IEHOVAH, <hi>and we ſhall be turned.</hi> So <hi>Cant.</hi> 5. 1. it was the voyce of Chriſt that awakened and rayſed vp the Church, when ſhe ſlept in her ſinnes.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, That God in his time will rayſe vp all that are his, how long ſoeuer they ſleepe in ſinne, as hee promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth in <note n="y" place="margin">Hoſhea 2. 14</note> 
                  <hi>Hoſhea,</hi> and as wee ſee in <hi>Dauid,</hi> who lay in his ſinne without Repentance, ſome whole yeere, as it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry like; and that ſeemeth to bee the force of the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which the Church vſeth, <hi>Ierem. 31. 18. Conuert thou me, that I may be conuerted: for thou art</hi> IEHOVAH <hi>my God.</hi> As if ſhe ſhould ſay, For thou onely art able to doe it, and wilt doe it for thy Couenant ſake.</p>
               <p>Howbeit this muſt not make vs the leſſe to feare ſin, becauſe the Children of God at one time or other repent them of it: No, not onely the vgly face of ſinne, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to the Image of God, who is Holineſſe it ſelfe, and the authour Satan, from whom it commeth, but the fruits and lamentable effects thereof ſhew, how much it is to be deteſted.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Wee offend God, and make ſad his holy Spirit, <hi>Eſay 63. 10. But they rebelled and grieued his holy Spirit. Epheſ. 4. 30. Grieue not the holy Spirit of God, by the which you are ſealed vnto the day of Redemption.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, We grieue and offend his Children. So the Apoſtle <note n="z" place="margin">2. Cor. 2. 5.</note> to the <hi>Corinths</hi> declareth himſelfe and all the Church, to haue beene grieued with that fact of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtuous perſon: <hi>If any man haue grieued, he hath not grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued me, but in part, that I doe not ouer-charge him, you all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, We cauſe his Goſpell to be blaſphemed and euill ſpoken of, <hi>Rom. 2. 24. The Name of GOD for your ſakes is blaſphemed amongst the Nations.</hi> Hereby is <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uids</hi> ſinne made the fouler and more hatefull, 2. <hi>Sam. 12. 14. Becauſe in ſo doing, thou haſt cauſed the enemies of</hi> IE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>HOVAH <hi>to prouoke and contemne him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, We make other to ſtumble and fall: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:29324:263"/> we know what our Sauiour ſaith, <hi>Mat. 18. 6. Whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer offendeth one of theſe little ones that beleeue in me, it were better for him that a Milſtone were hanged about his necke, and he drowned in the bottome of the Sea.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fiftly, Wee wound our owne ſoules with the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of our ſinnes, and the terror of Gods Iudgements: As <hi>Dauid</hi> confeſſeth of himſelfe, <note n="a" place="margin">Pſal. 51. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>Make mee to heare ioy and gladneſſe, that the bones which thou haſt broken may reioyce.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sixtly, We bereaue our ſelues of the ſweet comforts we haue felt, and that are to be had in him; as it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in that <hi>Pſalme,</hi> 
                  <note n="b" place="margin">Pſal. 51. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>Reſtore vnto me the ioy of thy ſaluation, and with thy free Spirit vphold me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Seuenthly, Wee bring manifold troubles and afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons vpon our perſons, vpon our Wiues, Children, Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, and thoſe that belong vnto vs, whereof if there were no more, that one example of <hi>Dauid</hi> may bee a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient witneſſe, and ſerue in ſtead of many:
<note n="c" place="margin">2. Sam. 12. 10, 11.</note> 
                  <hi>The Sword ſhall neuer depart from thy houſe for euer. I will rayſe vp againſt thee euill out of thine owne houſe: And I will take thy Wiues before thine eyes, and giue them to thy fellow, who ſhall lye with them before this Sunne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To conclude, it muſt coſt many bitter cryes and pitti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full lamentations, many a ſalt teare, deepe ſighes, ſobs, and grones, great deiection of minde, and abaſing of ones ſelfe, long exerciſe in the Schoole of Affliction, much ſtrife and ſtruggling, and many a plucke and wre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle (like true <hi>Iſraelites</hi>) with God himſelfe, our owne conſcience, and the feares and terrours of Hell, before we can come to obtayne a bleſſing at his hand, to be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured we are reconciled to him.</p>
               <p>And yet for all that, wee are not free from falling any more after we be once riſen: for euery day we fall, yea, oftentimes a day, and therefore haue need of a continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all and euery day Repentance.</p>
               <p>The greater queſtion is, whether wee may fall againe
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:29324:264"/> into the ſame ſinne, whereof truely we haue repented, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially if it be a groſſe and hainous ſinne? I anſwere, The beſt man in the World hath no priuiledge this way, but that as hee may lye long in his ſinne, ſo hee may fall againe into it: and as hee may fall once, ſo may hee fall twice, and ſo may hee fall oftener, and how oft the word (for ought I know) ſetteth not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſtint; neither are the Mercies of God, nor Merits of Chriſt to bee reſtrayned to ſo narrow bounds, but that where ſinne aboundeth, there grace doth more abound. Howbeit, he that ſhall ſo doe, ſpoyleth himſelfe of much comfort, and greatly ſhaketh the aſſurance of Faith, which euery Chriſtian ought to labour for; ſeeing a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall relapſe into one and the ſame offence, is a feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full argument of a man forſaken and giuen vp of God; yet all comfort is not wholy to be denyed to ſuch a one: for</p>
               <p>Firſt, <note n="d" place="margin">2. Cor. 8. 12.</note> 
                  <hi>If there be a willing mind, euery one is accepted for that grace he hath, not for that which he hath not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, <note n="e" place="margin">2. Cor. 12. 9, 10</note> 
                  <hi>The power of GOD is perfected in our weakneſſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſixt and laſt thing touching Repentance, is the meanes to ſpurre vs forwards to this duty, which is two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold. One, on the behalfe of God; the other, of our ſelues. On the behalfe of GOD, by the power of his Spirit, by the Miniſterie of his Word, by chaſtize<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and afflictions, by bleſſings and outward bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits, as he promiſeth in <note n="f" place="margin">Hoſh. 2. 14, 15, 16.</note> HOSHEA, <hi>Therefore, behold, I will perſwade her</hi> by my Spirit, <hi>after I haue brought her into the Wilderneſſe</hi> (and tamed her by afflictions) <hi>and will ſpeake vnto her heart,</hi> there is the word mouing: <hi>And will giue vnto her <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ineyards, &amp;c. that ſhe may ſing as in the dayes of her youth, and what time ſhee came out of the Land of Egypt.

               <pb n="501" facs="tcp:29324:264"/>
               <p>On our behalfe, for the better quickening of vs vnto this dutie, we are not onely carefully, and with a good conſcience, to vſe all the holy meanes ordayned of God for the conuerting of our ſoules, Prayer, Meditation of the Word, and other godly and profitable exerciſes, but eſpecially, ſometimes wee are to take vp the exerciſe of a true faſt commanded in the Word of God: for our <note n="h" place="margin">Mat. 17. 21.</note> Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour telleth vs, that there are ſome kinde of Deuils, whom Prayer only will not caſt out, vnleſſe it haue Faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ioyned with it.</p>

               <p>Firſt, Becauſe the beſt of all our workes in this life is ſtayned with ſome pollution, and therefore not able to ſtand before God, whoſe exact Iuſtice cannot abide the leaſt defect.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The Apoſtle ſaith expreſly, <hi>Rom. 3. 20. By the workes of the Law none can be iuſtified.</hi> Where, by <hi>the workes of the Law,</hi> hee meaneth not workes done by our owne ſtrength, without Faith and the Grace of God (as Papiſts abſurdly teach:) for <hi>whatſoever is not of Faith, is ſinne, Rom.</hi> 14. 23. And therefore a queſtion too vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy for the Apoſtle to diſpute, whether or no, works
<pb n="507" facs="tcp:29324:267"/> meerly ſinfull, without any manner of Goodneſſe in them, may iuſtifie in the ſight of God; neither can the Law bee done in any meaſure at all, by our owne ſtrength; for <hi>the wiſdome of the fleſh,</hi> or of the naturall and vnregenerate man, deſtitute of Gods Spirit, <hi>is enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie vnto God, and neither is, nor can be ſubiect to the Law of God,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 7. and thereof ſetteth himſelfe in the former Chapter for an example, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit <hi>in his minde,</hi> or part regenerate, <hi>hee ſerued the Law of God,</hi> yet <hi>in his fleſh,</hi> or part not regenerate, he ſerued <hi>the law of ſinne, Rom.</hi> 7. 22. Wherefore the very drift of the Apoſtle appeareth to be, to exclude all workes from iuſtifying, euen thoſe that are done by regenerate men in ſome meaſure, according to the rule and direction of the Law. For which purpoſe hee doth in this Argument ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the doctrine to the beſt and moſt righteous Iewes, that liued vnder the Law, <hi>Rom. 3. 19. Whatſoeuer the Law ſaith, it ſpeaketh to thoſe that are within the Law.</hi> And <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 4. 5. not onely to the Galatians that beleeued, but to himſelfe as one of that number, who <hi>not by the works of the Law, but by Faith waited for the hope,</hi> or hoped-for reward <hi>of Righteouſneſſe.</hi> Which he teacheth cleerly, <hi>Phil. 3. 9. That I might be found in him,</hi> (Chriſt) that is, <hi>not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing mine owne Righteouſneſſe, that which is by the Law, but that which is through the Faith of Christ, the Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe which is of God through Faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This further appeareth by <note n="i" place="margin">Ier. 23. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>Ieremie,</hi> calling Chriſt, IEHOVAH <hi>our Righteouſneſſe.</hi> Therefore Saluation commeth not by our owne. And when the <note n="k" place="margin">1. Cor. 1. 30.</note> Apoſtle ſaith, that <hi>Chriſt is made vnto vs of God, both Righteouſnes &amp; Sanctification,</hi> if the Popiſh doctrine of being iuſtified by the workes which Chriſt worketh in vs by his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, were true: it ſhould follow, that Iuſtice and Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, which the Apoſtle diſtinguiſheth, ſhould bee one. But that to the <note n="l" place="margin">Rom. 1. 17.</note> Romanes, <hi>In the Goſpell the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe of God is reuealed from Faith to Faith, as it is
<pb n="508" facs="tcp:29324:268"/> written, The righteous by Faith ſhall liue,</hi> is notable to this purpoſe.</p>
               <p>Firſt, In that the Apoſtle calleth it, <hi>The Righteouſneſſe of God which is by Faith:</hi> for ſeeing Faith apprehendeth not the workes contayned in the Law, but Chriſt alone; it muſt needes follow, that Chriſt, whome Faith appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hendeth, is our Iuſtice, and not the workes of the Law wrought by the Spirit of Chriſt, which is not the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect of Faith. And thereupon the Apoſtle teacheth, <hi>Gal. 3. 12. The Law is not of Faith, but the man that doth theſe things, ſhall liue by them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, When hee ſaith, that this Righteouſneſſe is reuealed <hi>from Faith to Faith,</hi> he declareth, that wee are iuſtified by Faith, not onely at the time when wee firſt beleeue, but that our whole and continuall Iuſtification is by Faith: otherwiſe hee ſhould not haue ſaid, From Faith to Faith, but, From Faith to Workes. And if Chriſt were not our Righteouſneſſe himſelfe, but obtayned onely power for vs, that wee might haue Righteouſneſſe in our ſelues, then hee ſhould not be our Sauiour, but an inſtrument of our Saluation.</p>
               <p>As for that which <hi>Iames</hi> ſaith, that <note n="m" place="margin">Iam. 2. 21, 25</note> ABRAHAM <hi>was iuſtified by workes,</hi> and ſo of <hi>Rahab:</hi> weighing the circumſtances of the Text, I ſuppoſe, hee vnderſtandeth by <hi>Workes,</hi> a liuely and a working Faith: for <hi>Iames</hi> oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth not the Workes of the Law to a true Faith, as <hi>Paul</hi> doth, but Workes, that is to ſay, an effectuall liuely Faith, that ſheweth his life and vigor by the fruits, to a dead and fruitleſſe Faith, which is no Faith, but a ſhad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow and carcaſe of Faith: So the ſemblance of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betweene the two Apoſtles may bee conceiued to be, not in the word <hi>Iuſtifying,</hi> which with them both go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, for that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> is, to be made righteous in the ſight and iudgement of God: but in the terme of Workes, <hi>Paul</hi> taking them literally, <hi>Iames</hi> by a <hi>Metonymie,</hi> for Faith that bringeth them forth: aſcribing that to the effect
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:29324:268"/> which he intendeth proper to the cauſe, from whence of neceſſitie and vnſeparably it commeth. And this to bee his meaning, may be gathered by <note n="n" place="margin">Verſe 17, 20.</note> many paſſages, but eſpecially, <hi>Verſe</hi> 23. where that which he had ſaid <note n="o" place="margin">Verſe 11.</note> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately before, <hi>Was not</hi> ABRAHAM <hi>iustified by workes?</hi> he explaineth to be as much as, ABRAHAM <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued God, and it was imputed to him for Righteouſneſſe.</hi> But albeit good workes doe not iuſti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Firſt, God is hereby glorified, as our Sauiour teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vs: <note n="p" place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>Secondly, Wee gather from hence aſſurance that wee are the Children of God, and they ſerue as Teſtimonies and Pledges both to our ſelues and others, that wee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to him: for which cauſe our Sauiour ſheweth, how in that great Day of his moſt glorious Comming, all fleſh ſhall be iudged, not by their Faith or vnbeliefe, but by their Workes, as ſure Arguments to approue to all the World, the righteous Sentence of God; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to our ſelues, they ſeale vp Gods Election, and make it ſure to vs: for whoſoeuer findeth not that hee hath in ſome meaſure the Spirit of Sanctification, the Grace of Addoption and Iuſtification hath not yet laid hold vpon him. Hither tend thoſe exhortations, ſo common in the Scripture,
<note n="r" place="margin">2 Pet. 1. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>Make your Calling and Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction firme</hi> by your Workes, &amp;c. True it is (as <note n="ſ" place="margin">2. Tim. 2. 19.</note> the Apoſtle ſaith) that there is a double Seale; one reſting in God himſelfe, which is firme and ſure and neuer can be ſhaken, but the other reſteth in vs, who are by good Workes to ſet that Seale vpon our Soules and Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, <hi>The foundation of God remayneth firme, hauing this Seale; God knoweth who are his. And, Let euerie one
<pb n="510" facs="tcp:29324:269"/> that nameth the Name of</hi> CHRIST, <hi>depart from iniquitie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, Good Workes in thoſe that profeſſe Chriſt, ſtop the mouth of the Aduerſarie, who otherwiſe is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to ſlander the Goſpell, and to ſpeake euill of it, as of a doctrine of libertie. So ſaith <note n="t" place="margin">1. Pet. 2. 15.</note> PETER, <hi>For ſo is the will of God, that doing well, you might ſtop the mouth of the ignorance of fooliſhmen, as free, and not hauing libertie as a couer of naughtineſſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, By this meanes wee giue a good Example vnto other, and winne many to the profeſſion of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell. Whereupon the ſame <note n="u" place="margin">1. Pet. 3. 12.</note> Apoſtle exhorteth Wiues ſo to behaue themſelues, that by the beholding of their chaſte and modeſt carriage, their Husbands that beleeue not the Word, may, without the Word bee gayned vnto Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, God is pleaſed, and hath promiſed, of his free Mercie and Goodneſſe, to beſtow a reward vpon them: which ought to quicken vs to this dutie, 1. <hi>Cor. 3. 8. Eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one ſhall receiue his owne reward, according to his owne la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, 2. Iohn, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>erſe 8. Take heed to your ſelues, that we loſe not the good things we haue wrought, but that we may receiue a full reward.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thus farre touching our Sanctification; in this<note place="margin">Hereafter wee ſhall haue an Angellike per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</note> life weake and imperfect, which in Heauen ſhall be fully and wholy perfected, and we, when receiued vp vnto Chriſt, ſhall bee made <note n="x" place="margin">Epheſ. 5. 27.</note> glorious, without ſpot or wrinkle, or any ſuch thing, and
<note n="y" place="margin">Mat. 22. 30.</note> like to the holy An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels. This abſolute perfection and Angellicall puritie, free from the leaſt ſpot of ſinne whatſoeuer, is a thing that muſt neceſſarily be attayned vnto.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Becauſe elſe we ſhould not haue, by the Mercie of God in Chriſt, as good and holy an eſtate, as we had by our firſt Creation, and loſt by our owne ſinnes in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, So long as man is imperfectly holy,
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:29324:269"/> hee can neuer bee perfectly happie, by inioying the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God, before whom no ſinfull thing can come.</p>
               <p>Now this I mean, that in this eſtate we ſhalbe perfectly righteous, not onely by Chriſts obedience imputed vnto vs, &amp; made ours, but by a righteouſnes alſo inhere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in our ſelues: for in the life to come, the Elect ſhalbee reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to that perfect inherent Holineſſe wherein <hi>Adam</hi> was created, but in a more excellent meaſure, euen in the full height and top of all perfection; and great reaſon there is why we ſhall then ſo much excell.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Becauſe the faculties of our ſoule and bodie ſhal then bee made ſpirituall, and glorified in an excellent manner, as wee ſhewed before, whereby to bee more quicke and readie for the performance of euery good and holy dutie then <hi>Adam</hi> was.</p>
               <p>Secondly, In reſpect of the place where wee ſhall be; in Heauen, where
<note n="z" place="margin">1. Cor. 13. 12.</note> 
                  <hi>wee ſhall ſee God face to face,</hi> and haue familiar conuerſation in his preſence.</p>
               <p>This Celeſtiall Holineſſe is all one with that which we haue in this World, euen as our bodies and ſoules are the ſame, but differing in the excellent meaſure of it.</p>
               <p>That which followeth of this Angellicall perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is,</p>
               <p>Firſt, That there ſhall bee no more ſtrife nor warfare againſt ſinne; Satan himſelfe and all our ſpirituall foes being trodden vnder our feete, and the Goale wee now ſtriue for, gotten and wonne: whereupon the Church of God in Heauen is called, The Church Triumphant; for

                  <hi>they ceaſe from their labours.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, That there is no more Repentance, no more ſorrow and griefe for ſinne,
<note n="b" place="margin">Reuel. 21. 4, 5</note> 
                  <hi>neither paine, nor crying, nor labour: for all teares ſhall bee wiped from their eyes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After the Doctrine of Sanctification, order requireth<note place="margin">Redemption, whereby</note> to ſpeake of Redemption. A double Redemption or (to ſpeake more properly) Redemption in a double ſence we find ſpoken of in the Scripture. One, the paying of
<pb n="512" facs="tcp:29324:270"/> the price, by the ſheading of Chriſts Bloud, to free vs from the ſeruitude of ſinne and death: which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle toucheth, <hi>Epheſ. 1. 7. and Coloſſ.</hi> 1. 14. and is the ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome or matter of our Redemption. The other, a fruit and effect of the former, which, in that place to the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſians,</hi> 
                  <note n="c" place="margin">Epheſ. 1. 14.</note> is alſo mentioned, when by him wee are ſet free indeed. And that is the Redemption meant, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 30. in the purting away of euill, and the beſtowing of<note place="margin">freeing vs from the curſe (himſelfe be comming a curſe for vs)</note> all good. Wherfore two parts here offer themſelues. One is, the remoouing of our curſed eſtate, ſetting vs free from Death, Hell, and Condemnation, and from the Curſe of the Law, by his Death and Sufferings: for <hi>by death hee hath aboliſhed him that hath the power of death, that is, the Deuill, and ſet them free, who through feare of death, were all their life long ſubiect vnto bondage,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle to the <note n="d" place="margin">Heb. 2. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>Hebrewes.</hi> And <hi>Gal. 3. 8. Chriſt hath redeemed vs from the Curſe of the Law being made a Curſe for vs, as it is written, Curſed is euery one that hangeth vpon the Tree.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The other is, the making of vs bleſſed by the partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation<note place="margin">hee maketh vs bleſſed, by the participation of his Bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</note> of his Bleſſedneſſe. A reward that followeth our Iuſtification through Chriſt. So wee are plainly taught, <hi>G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>l. 3. 8. The Scripture fore-ſeeing that by Faith God would iustifie the Nations, publiſhed the glad tidings before vnto</hi> ABRAHAM, <hi>that in thee</hi> (that is, in thy Seed, Chriſt Ieſus) <hi>ſhall all Nations be bleſſed:</hi> for being approoued of God as righteous in Chriſt, conſequently in him wee are to haue a reward. <hi>Reuel. 16. 6. They ſhall walke with mee in Whites: for they are worthy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The diſtinct degrees of Bleſſedneſſe come now to be<note place="margin">Our Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſſe, in the eſtate we now are in, ſtandeth</note> conſidered: for truly may the Children of God be ſaid, euen in this life bleſſed; meaning it in part, as a ſtep and ſtayre to climbe vp vnto full and perfect Happineſſe. And thereof came thoſe Phraſes,
<note n="e" place="margin">Iohn 6. 47.</note> 
                  <hi>He that beleeueth in me:</hi> (or as it is in another place) <note n="f" place="margin">Iohn 3. 36.</note> 
                  <hi>Hee that beleeueth in the Sonne, hath euerlaſting life, and commeth not vnto iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,

                  <hi>Wee know that wee are (alreadie) paſſed from death to life, becauſe we loue the Brethren.</hi> That is the reaſon why the <note n="i" place="margin">Rom. 8. 29.</note> Apoſtle ſpeaketh in the preſent, or time paſt, not in the future, when he ſaith, <hi>Whom he hath iuſtified, them he hath alſo glorified.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The particularities of this degree of Happineſſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide our Vnion with Chriſt, and through him, with God, whereof wee haue ſpoken alreadie, are theſe that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low:</p>
               <p>Firſt, The loue of God <note n="k" place="margin">Heb. 12. 6.</note> anew, that now he vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafeth<note place="margin">Firſt, in the Loue of God anew.</note> to call vs friends: As we reade of ABRAHAM, that <hi>he was called the friend of God, Iames</hi> 2. 33.</p>
               <p>Whereof follow three excellent conſequences:</p>
               <p>Firſt, His generall goodneſſe in the gouernment of the World, doth after a more ſpeciall and louing manner extend vnto the faithfull, and that three manner of wayes:</p>
               <p>Firſt, In an extraordinary bountie and goodneſſe: In which ſence the

               </p>
               <p>Secondly, In a moſt fatherly prouidence ouer his Church and choſen people, of whome hee letteth not ſo much as <note n="n" place="margin">Pſal. 34. 20.</note>

In the middeſt of theſe, how were it poſſible for a man to bee quiet, if hee did not reſt aſſured, that God had a ſpeciall care of him? which when once his heart con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiueth, by and by all feare and perplexitie flyeth from him; and caſting all his care on God, Hee ſaith boldly, <note n="ſ" place="margin">Pſal. 27. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>Though an Armie pitch againſt me, my heart ſhall not bee afraid. Though Warre riſe vp againſt mee, in that will I haue truſt.</hi>

                  <hi>He ſhall deliuer thee from the ſnare of the hunter, from the plaguie pestilence: with his feathers ſhall he couer thee, when thou betakest thy ſelfe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his wing, a ſhield and buckler his truth ſhall bee. Thou ſhalt not bee afraid of the feare by night, of the Arrow that flyeth in the day, of the Peſtilence that walketh in a miſt, of the Murraine that waſteth at noone day: a thouſand falling at thy ſide, and ten thouſand at thy right hand, it ſhall not come neere to thee.</hi> In a word, no open, nor ſecret, outward, nor inward, bodily, nor ſpirituall euill, no not at any time, ſhall bee able to preuaile againſt thee.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, In all kindneſſe and mercie comforting them in their diſtreſſes, as hee hath promiſed, <hi>To</hi> 
                  <note n="y" place="margin">Eſay 25. 8.</note>

                  <hi>For a little time I haue left thee, but with euerlaſting Mercies will I ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thee: with a little wrath did I hide my face from thee for a moment, but with euerlasting kindneſſe will I haue mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie vpon thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="515" facs="tcp:29324:271"/>
               <p>The ſecond conſequence is, that all things turne vnto<note place="margin">whereby all things,</note> our good: <hi>We know,</hi> ſaith the
<note n="c" place="margin">Rom. 8. 28.</note> Apoſtle to the <hi>Romanes, that to them that loue God, all things worke together to good.</hi> In which reſpect he ſaith in
<note n="d" place="margin">1. Cor. 3. 21, 22</note> another place, <hi>All things are yours, whether life, or death, or things preſent, or things to come, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To declare this more particularly:</p>
               <p>Firſt, The calamities and troubles of this life, are not<note place="margin">not the cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities onely and troubles of this life,</note> now any puniſhment of ſin vnto vs, which is all borne in Chriſt; but fatherly chaſtizements for our amendment; whereunto that ſentence of the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 28. more ſpecially driueth. And this is the Couenant and promiſe of God, <hi>Pſal. 89. 31, 32, 33, 34. If his ſonnes for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake my Law, and walke not in my Statutes, &amp;c. I will viſit their tranſgreſſions with the Rod, and their inquitie with ſtripes: but my kindneſſe I will not put from him, nor falſific my faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, Death it ſelfe hath loſt his ſting, and the<note place="margin">and alſo death it ſelfe,</note> Graue his victorie. Being no more fearefull and terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but the gate of hope, and a ſweet &amp; pleaſant paſſage vnto life and immortalitie: In ſo much as knowing the nature of it to be changed from a puniſhment of ſinne, which properly it is vnto a good and happie thing, wee come now to deſire it, and to wiſh for it: <hi>Phil. 1. 23. I deſire to bee diſſolued, and to bee with Chriſt.</hi> Wherefore, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 22. death is ſaid to be ours, and to ſerue for our good. And to the <note n="e" place="margin">Heb. 2. 14, 15</note> 
                  <hi>Hebrewes,</hi> that <hi>Chriſt by his death doth ſet vs free from all feare of death.</hi> Hence ariſeth the <note n="f" place="margin">1. Cor. 15. 55.</note> Apoſtles holy triumphing ouer it, <hi>O Death, where is thy ſting? O Graue, where is thy victorie?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, Our verie ſinnes, by the wonderfull Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe<note place="margin">but euen our very ſins turne vnto our good:</note> of God, and his admirable and vnſpeakable Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, who bringeth light out of darkneſſe, ſerue for our further ſtrengthening and incouragement vnto good.</p>
               <p>For, firſt, they tend to manifeſt our owne weakneſſe and corruption, and to make vs more watchfull in time
<pb n="516" facs="tcp:29324:272"/> to come, and more to wreſtle with our owne ſoules a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the temptations of ſinne.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Heereby wee haue more plentifull matter and arguments miniſtred vnto vs, to confirme our ſelues in Gods Mercies, and to reach and inſtruct others; which vſe our
<note n="g" place="margin">Luke 22. 32.</note> Sauiour noteth in the Apoſtaſie of <hi>Peter, Thou, when thou art conuerted, ſtrengthen thy Brethren.</hi> And <hi>Dauid</hi>

               </p>
               <p>The third conſequence is, a heape and multitude of<note place="margin">and in the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance whereof</note> ſpirituall Graces, wrought in our hearts by the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Aſſurance of the loue of God in Chriſt, ſealed vp in our conſciences by the teſtimonie of the Spirit: for <hi>the</hi> 
                  <note n="i" place="margin">Rom 8. 16.</note>

               </p>
               <p>Secondly, Peace of conſcience.<note place="margin">we haue peace of conſcience, and Ioy in the Holy Ghoſt.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, Ioy in the Holy Ghoſt, procceding from the teſtimonie of a good conſcience, as the Apoſtle teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth 1. <hi>Cor. 2. 12. For this is our reioycing, the teſtimonie of our conſcience.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſame Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 17. coupleth theſe two together, as ſpeciall fruites of the Righteouſneſſe wee haue in Chriſt: <hi>The Kingdome of God is not meate and drinke, but Righteouſneſſe, and Peace, and Ioy in the Holy Ghoſt.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Secondly, in that we are made neere vnto him,</note>
               </p>
               <p>To come to the ſecond of thoſe generall heads, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in our happineſſe heere ſtandeth, wee <note n="l" place="margin">Epheſ. 2. 13.</note> which before were farre off, are brought neere vnto God, in Chriſt;
<pb n="517" facs="tcp:29324:272"/> and <note n="m" place="margin">Epheſ. 2. 19.</note> therefore are no more Strangers, and Forainers, but Citizens with the Saints, and of the houſhold of GOD.</p>
               <p>From whence another excellent fauour commeth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that<note place="margin">and haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall acceſſe with boldneſſe into his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence.</note> wee haue continuall acceſſe vnto the Throne of grace, and entrance with boldneſſe into his preſence, as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle teacheth, <hi>Epheſ. 3. 12.

                  <hi>By him we both (Gentiles</hi> aſwell as <hi>Iewes) haue acceſſe, through one Spirit, vnto the Father.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For this and the reſt that went before, that place is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie ſingular, <hi>Rom. 5. 1, 2, 5. Being iuſtified by Faith, wee haue peace with God, through Ieſus Chriſt our Lord: by whom alſo we haue acceſſe, through Faith, into this Grace wherein we ſtand, and reioyce, vnder the hope of the Glorie of God: for the loue of God is ſhed in our hearts by the Holy Ghost that is giuen vnto vs</hi> (whereas you ſee) all are compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended.</p>
               <p>The third is our Soueraigntie renewed: which you<note place="margin">Thirdly, in our former Soueraigntie, and power o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</note> may conſider in theſe three ſteps or degrees:</p>

               </p>
               <p>This hath not beene alwayes ſo from the beginning; it pleaſed God to make ſome reſtraints, till the fulneſſe of time came, that by degrees this libertie might bee made knowne vnto the Church.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Before the giuing of the Law, in ſome few things, and peraduenture (for I ſpeak heere but of things for common vſe, not of the Seruice of God) onely that one of forbidding to eat bloud, <hi>Gen.</hi> 9. 4. whereas other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe <note n="r" place="margin">Gen. 9. 3.</note> all meates were lawfull.</p>
               <p>Secondly, After that, more plentifully and aboundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the <hi>Iewiſh</hi> Pedagogie, when many meats &amp; drinks, and other things were barred them.</p>
               <p>The libertie then which we haue by Chriſt, take from the Apoſtles words, <hi>I know, and am perſwaded in the Lord Ieſus, that nothing is prophane, Rom.</hi> 14. 14. And againe, <hi>Euery Creature of God is good, and none to bee reiect, if it be taken with Thankeſgiuing, 1. Tim.</hi> 4. 3.</p>
               <p>Not that it is lawfull for vs to take ſo great a libertie herein, as though we needed to reſpect no other but our ſelues; wee muſt reſpect the infirmities of our weake Brethren, that our libertie bee not vſed as a ſnare to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trap others, and ſo make them to offend: but to edifie and build vp their conſcience, whereof the Apoſtle ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times taketh vs out the Leſſon, both by his owne practice and commandement, 1. <hi>Cor. 9. 19. Being free from all, I made my ſelfe a ſeruant vnto all, that I might gaine many, &amp;c. 1. Cor. 10. 23, 24. All things are lawfull for me:
<pb n="519" facs="tcp:29324:273"/> but all things are not expedient. All things are lawfull for me: but all things doe not edifie. Let no man ſeeke his owne things, but euery one another mans.</hi> And againe, <note n="ſ" place="margin">
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>erſe 32, 33.</note> 
                  <hi>Be without of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, to Iewes and Gentiles, and to the Church of God. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen as I in all things pleaſe all men, not ſeeking mine owne profit, but the profit of many, that they may be ſaued, Rom. 14 13, &amp;c. Let vs not therefore iudge one another; but this ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther iudge, not to lay a ſtumbling blocke before thy Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or an offence. Deſtroy not him by thy meate, for whom Chriſt dyed. Let not therefore your good</hi> (ſo calling that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie which Chriſt hath purchaſed for vs) <hi>be euill ſpoken of. Let vs therefore follow after the things of peace, and of edification one towards another. Deſtroy not for meates ſake the worke of God. All things indeed are cleane: but it is ill for the man that eateth with offence. It is good not to eate fleſh, nor to drinke wine, nor to doe any thing whereby thy Brother ſtumbleth, or is offended, or made weake.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To ſet downe therefore the cautions that are to bee giuen heerein, and how, and in what caſes wee are ſo to bridle our Chriſtian libertie.</p>
               <p>The firſt caution is, that it bee in things which GOD hath once reſtrayned: for no Law of God, nor rule of Charitie bindeth to forbeare meates, or drinkes, or other things which neuer were vnlawfull by the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, but by the vaine ſuperſtition of men: that being but to giue ſtrength and countenance to the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Deuils, with which name the Apoſtle brandeth them, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 1.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It muſt bee but to beare with our weake Brethren, and for awhile,
<note n="t" place="margin">Act. 15, 28, 29</note> till they may be better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of the libertie they haue in Chriſt; it muſt not bee to nouriſh or ſtrengthen men in euill, nor when it tendeth not to edification but deſtruction: So did <note n="u" place="margin">Act. 16. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>Paul</hi> circumciſe <hi>Timothy,</hi> not as the Sacrament that God had once ordayned, but as a bare Ceremonie and thing indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, which he had free power to vſe for the edificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="520" facs="tcp:29324:274"/> of the Church, till the aboliſhing of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Ceremonies by the comming of Chriſt were better knowne. But <note n="x" place="margin">Gal. 2. 4, 5.</note> 
                  <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> he would in no ſort circumciſe, when he ſaw he could not doe it without betraying the Truth of the Goſpell, and giuing occaſion to the aduerſaries againſt him.</p>
               <p>The ſecond ſtep of our Soueraigntie renewed, is the<note place="margin">and deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance from the bondage of Satan.</note> ſetting vs free from the bondage and ſlauerie of Satan, vnder whom we were held before in thraldome, in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall feare of death, as the Apoſtle teacheth, <hi>Heb. 2. 14. 15. that by death he might aboliſh him that hath the power of death, that is to ſay, the Deuil, and might ſet free</hi> from his tyrannie and dominion, <hi>as many as through feare of death were all their life long ſubiect vnto bondage.</hi> This was the firſt promiſe made in Paradiſe: <note n="y" place="margin">Gen. 3. 15.</note> 
                  <hi>The ſeed of the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> Chriſt, and in him, and by his power, all thoſe that are his, <hi>ſhall bruiſe the head of the Serpent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third &amp; laſt, is a noble priuiledge and prerogatiue<note place="margin">This alſo as a noble acceſſe added there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, that the holy Angels themſelues are made Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters for our good.</note> to Gods children, ouer &amp; aboue all that <hi>Ada<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  </hi> had; that the holy Angels themſelues are made Miniſters for our good, whereof there bee many moſt glorious promiſes in the Word, <hi>Pſal. 91. 11. Hee will giue his Angels charge ouer thee, to keepe thee in all thy wayes.</hi> A fauour principally meant to Chriſt, the Head of the Church, and after him, to all the faithfull. Generally, the Apoſtle to the <note n="z" place="margin">Heb. 1. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewes</hi> ſaith, <hi>They are miniſtring Spirits ſent forth for their ſakes that are to inherit ſaluation.</hi> And in the Pſalme, <note n="a" place="margin">Pſal. 34. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>The Angell of</hi> IEHOVAH <hi>pitcheth his Tents round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout thoſe that feare him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hereupon our Sauiour calleth them <hi>our</hi> 
                  <note n="b" place="margin">Mat. 18. 10. See you deſpiſe not one of theſe little ones, for I ſay vnto you, that their Angels in Heauen doe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes behold the face of my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, &amp;c.</note> 
                  <hi>Angels:</hi> for firſt, thorowout the courſe of our life they watch o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer vs, to keepe vs in all our wayes, that no euill ſhould come vnto vs, as it followeth in that <note n="c" place="margin">Pſal. 91. 12, 13</note> 
                  <hi>Pſalme,</hi> and as wee are taught not onely by the Example of <note n="d" place="margin">Dan. 1. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>Daniel,</hi> for whoſe ſake God ſent his Angell to ſtop the mouth of the Lyons, that they ſhould not hurt him: And of <hi>Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drach,</hi> 
                  <note n="e" place="margin">Dan. 3. 28.</note> 
                  <hi>Meſhach,</hi> and <hi>Abednego,</hi> deliuered by an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell
<pb n="521" facs="tcp:29324:274"/> from the fury of the flame, which the prophane King himſelfe was driuen to acknowledge; and of diuers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers whoſe liues are regiſtred in the Scriptures: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, by the manifold experience that euery one of vs hath in our ſelues in ſo many, ſo wonderfull, and ſo ſtrange eſcapes, whereof no reaſon can be aſſigned, but the Angels watchfull attendance and garding of vs.</p>
               <p>Secondly, In the houre of death they are about vs, readie at the laſt gaſpe to receiue our Soule, and by their Miniſterie to conuey it vp to Heauen: for when <hi>Lazarus</hi> dyed,
<note n="f" place="margin">Luke 16. 22.</note> 
                  <hi>He was carryed</hi> (ſaith our Sauiour Chriſt) <hi>of the Angels into</hi> ABRAHAMS <hi>boſome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The right whereby wee haue this, is, becauſe being ſeruants vnto Chriſt, who is the Head, conſequently they are to ſerue the faithfull, which are his members.</p>
               <p>The excellencie of their ſeruice the Scripture com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendeth vnto vs by diuers arguments.</p>
               <p>Firſt, By their nature qualified and made fit for it, in that they are Spirits.</p>
               <p>Secondly, By their rule and ſoueraigntie, being them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues called <hi>Thrones, Dominions, Principalities, Gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Chiefe Princes, &amp;c.</hi> And what a thing is it then, to haue ſo great Princes attending on vs?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, By their power, able to throw downe what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer doth withſtand them. Whereof, among many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, we haue a famous Example of one Angell, that in one night ſlue one hundred, foureſcore and fiue thouſand of the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> Campe, 2. <hi>Kings</hi> 19. 25.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, By their Glorie, to terrifie and amaze our Aduerſaries, as we reade in MATTHEW, <hi>The</hi> 
                  <note n="g" place="margin">Mat. 28. 3, 4.</note> 
                  <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell of the Lord came downe from Heauen, whoſe counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance was like lightening, and his garment white as ſnow: for feare of him the Keepers were ſmitten, and became as dead men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fiftly, By their Wiſdome and Knowledge.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, By the place where they dwell, being in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen;
<pb n="522" facs="tcp:29324:275"/> and therefore haue all aduantages to doe vs good.</p>
               <p>Seuenthly, By the multitude and number of holy An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, which maketh not a little for the ſtrengthening of our Faith: for euen among men, <hi>A</hi> 
                  <note n="h" place="margin">Eccleſ. 4. 12.</note> 
                  <hi>threefold cord is not eaſily broken.</hi> When <note n="i" place="margin">Gen. 32. 1, 2.</note> 
                  <hi>Iacob</hi> went on his way, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne into his Countrey, as God had commanded him, the Angels of God met him; euen a whole Armie and troope of Angels, in ſo much as hee called the name of the place, <hi>Machanaima,</hi> a payre of Armies, his owne and the Angels Armie. So in
<note n="k" place="margin">Luke 2. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>Luke</hi> it is ſaid, that <hi>there was with the Shepherds a multitude of an heauenly Armie.</hi> In the <note n="l" place="margin">Pſal. 68. 17.</note> 
                  <hi>Pſalmes, They are named many thouſands of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels.</hi> And to the
<note n="m" place="margin">Heb. 12. 22.</note> 
                  <hi>Hebrewes, Myriades</hi> (that is, ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands) <hi>of Angels.</hi> 
                  <note n="n" place="margin">Dan. 7. 10.</note> DANIEL alſo reckoneth a <hi>thouſand thouſand ſtanding before the Ancient of dayes.</hi> By this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument <note n="o" place="margin">2. Kings 6. 15 16, 17.</note> 
                  <hi>Eliſha</hi> the man of God incourageth his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant, when ſeeing the Companies and troopes of men that compaſſed the Citie, and Horſes and Chariots, hee cryed out, <hi>Alas, Maſter, what ſhall wee doe? To whom</hi> ELISHA <hi>ſaid, Feare not: for there bee moe with vs then are with them.</hi> Then praying to <hi>Iehouah,</hi> the Seruants eyes were opened, <hi>and he ſaw the Mountaynes were full with Horſes, and Chariots of fire round about</hi> ELISHA. And our Sauiour Chriſt by the ſame argument ſheweth, how able he had beene to free himſelfe from the hands of his enemies:
<note n="p" place="margin">Mat. 26. 53.</note> 
                  <hi>Could not I pray vnto my Father, and he would giue mee more then twelue Legions of Angels?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Eighthly and laſtly, by their willingneſſe vnto this Seruice, declared for the moſt part by three circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances.</p>
               <p>Firſt, They ſtand continually in Gods preſence, way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, as it were, for a Commiſſion from him to doe vs good, <hi>Mat. 18. 10. Their Angels ſee alwayes the face of my Father which is in Heauen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, They are glad and reioyce at the good of his Saints. So <hi>Luke</hi> 2. 13, 14. they declare themſelues
<pb n="523" facs="tcp:29324:275"/> not a little affected with the ioy of the glad tydings which they brought vnto the Shepheards, <hi>They prayſed God, and ſaid, Glorie vnto God on high, in Earth peace, and good will towards men.</hi> And our Sauiour telleth vs, <hi>There</hi> 
                  <note n="q" place="margin">Luk. 15. 7, 10</note> 
                  <hi>is ioy in Heauen with the Angels of God for ſinners that repent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, They are preſt and readie at Gods Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, with all ſpeed to put the ſame in practice. This the <note n="r" place="margin">Pſal. 103. 20.</note> Pſalmiſt commendeth in them, <hi>Bleſſe</hi> IEHOVAH, <hi>ye his Angels, which doe his Word, which harken to his voice.</hi> Our Sauiour likewiſe teacheth vs to pray, <hi>Thy will bee done in Earth as it in Heauen.</hi> The ſpeed and cheerfulneſſe they vſe in executing Gods Commiſſions, was figured vnder the Law, by the Cherubins in the Tabernacle, painted with wings: wherefore, <hi>Pſalme</hi> 18. 10. God is ſaid to come riding vpon them as vpon Chariots, and flying as it were with wings. In the Viſion of <note n="ſ" place="margin">Eſay 6. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>Eſaia</hi> they haue each of them <hi>ſix wings, whereof with two they flye:</hi> yea, ſo ſwiftly and ſo earneſtly doe they flye, that, as it were, they wearie themſelues with flying, as of the Angell <note n="t" place="margin">Dan. 9. 21.</note> 
                  <hi>Gabriel</hi> it is expreſſely ſpoken. Theſe qualities before named are all of them figured in the Viſion of <note n="u" place="margin">Ezech. 1. 10. &amp; 10. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>Ezechiel,</hi> where the foure liuing creatures, which are the holy Angels, are ſaid to haue each of them foure fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; <hi>the face of a man, the face of a Lyon, the face of an Oxe, and the face of an Eagle.</hi> By the Similitude of a man, their wiſedome and vnderſtanding is incled, which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all earthly Creatures is onely to be found in man; in a Lyon their ſtrength and power; their labour and induſtrie in an Oxe or Heifar: (without whom the Crib is emptie) but much increaſe commeth by his trauell, ſaith the Wiſeman in his <hi>Prouerbs.</hi> And laſtly, their ſwift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, in an Eagle, which the better to recommend in that Fowle, <note n="x" place="margin">Reuel. 4. 7.</note>

               <p>The laſt of thoſe generall heads, wherein we place our<note place="margin">Fourthly, in a ſpirituall glory and wiſdome, and other graces.</note> happineſſe in this life, is a ſpirituall glorie and wiſdome, and other graces, whereof the Preacher <note n="a" place="margin">Eccleſ. 8. 1.</note> ſpeaketh, <hi>The wiſdome of a man maketh his face to ſhine.</hi> And <hi>Paul,</hi> 
                  <note n="b" place="margin">2. Cor. 3. 18.</note> 
                  <hi>We all with open face beholding, as in a Glaſſe, the glorie of the Lord, are transformed into the ſame Image, from glorie to glorie:</hi> that is, by the participation of his glorie, our ſelues become glorious, as it were by the reflexion of his beames.</p>
               <p>Our perfect Bleſſedneſſe or Redemption (which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth<note place="margin">After this life, commeth the fulneſſe of Bleſſedneſſe,</note> in the laſt place to bee handled) wee conſider in foure ſteps or degrees of glorie, which all the members of Chriſt ſhall bee made partakers of, anſwerable to their Head.</p>
               <p>To them all two things pertayne in common; the<note place="margin">more or leſſe, according to the diuers meaſure of our Faith here. To the ſoule in Heauen, preſently after death, till the latter Day.</note> place where wee ſhall enioy it, Heauen: and the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring meaſure of glorie. But theſe two will come in bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, when the reſt are once handled.</p>
               <p>Wherefore the firſt degree is that, which is to the ſoule onely, and that preſently after death, till the latter Day, our bodies reſting in the graue, vnto the time of the reſtoring of all things, as the bodies of the wicked alſo doe; betweene whom and vs, there is in this reſpect no difference.</p>
               <p>But for our ſoules, aſſoone as the period<note place="margin">Popiſh Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatorie, and <hi>Limbus Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trum.</hi>
                  </note> of this life is runne out, they are forthwith carryed into Heauen by the Miniſterie of the holy Angels. So the Preacher ſaith, <note n="c" place="margin">Eccleſ. 12. 9.</note>

And this eſtate both of the Elect and Reprobate, our Sauiour Chriſt expreſly ſheweth in the Parable of the Rich man. The very ſcope whereof dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth vnto this, that although the wicked, in this life, for the moſt part, enioy pleaſure, and the Saints of God are pinched with penury, yet that after death there abides a large recompence for the godly, when to the wicked ſhall be anguiſh and ſorrow.

               <p>The ſecond degree is a better and more excellent<note place="margin">At what time</note> condition after that both to ſoule and bodie, for the full effecting whereof, there bee two moſt glorious and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned
<pb n="526" facs="tcp:29324:277"/> workes, the wonders of the World, which Chriſt our Lord and King ſhall by the power and force of his Kingdome, and by vertue of that Office giuen vnto him of his Father, performe in the latter Day, to the euerlaſting ioy and comfort of his Children: In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect whereof, that Day is called, <hi>The Day of the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thoſe are a generall Reſurrection and the laſt Iudgement.</p>
               <p>By the generall Reſurrection, I meane, that there ſhall<note place="margin">our bodies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rayſed vp</note> be a rayſing vp of all the dead bodies which haue ſlept, or ſhall ſleepe in the Duſt of the Earth: that ſo being knit againe into one perſon with their ſoules, both bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies and ſoules may receiue according to the things they haue done in this World, whether they be good or euill. So ſaith the Prophet <note n="m" place="margin">Dan. 12. 2.</note> DANIEL, <hi>At the length many of them that ſlept in the duſtie earth, ſhall awake, theſe to euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting life, and thoſe to ſhame and reproch euerlaſting.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And our Sauiour Chriſt, <hi>Iohn 5. 28, 29. The houre com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, wherein all that are in the graues, ſhall heare his voyce, and ſhall come forth: they which haue done good things, vnto the Reſurrection of life, and they which haue done euill things, vnto the Reſurrection of condemnation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In this Doctrine of the Reſurrection, I note,</p>
               <p>Firſt, Who ſhall ariſe. All the dead without excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>both iuſt and vniust,</hi> as it is ſaid, <hi>Acts</hi> 24. 15.</p>
               <p>Secondly, By what power they ſhall ariſe: by the power and voyce of Chriſt, vſing the Miniſterie of an Archangell or a Chiefe and a Principall Angell, <hi>Iohn 5. 28. The houre commeth, when all that are in the graue, ſhall heare his voyce, and ſhall come forth, &amp;c. 1. Theſ. 4. 16. The Lord himſelfe with a ſhowting, with the voyce of an Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angell, and with the Trumpet of God, ſhall come downe from Heauen, and the dead in Chriſt ſhal ariſe. 1. Cor. 15. 52 The Trumpet ſhall ſound, and the dead ſhall be rayſed vp.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, In what ſort we ſhall ariſe. In the ſelfe-ſame bodies that we now carrie about vs, as <note n="n" place="margin">Iob 19. 25, 26, 27.</note> 
                  <hi>Iob</hi> ſaith, <hi>I know that my Redeemer liueth, and that the latter man ſhall
<pb n="527" facs="tcp:29324:277"/> riſe vp vpon the duſt. Therefore after, I ſhall awake, and the Wormes haue digged thorow this, yet in my fleſh ſhall I ſee God: euen I, the ſelfe-ſame that I am, and not a ſtranger, ſhall ſee for my ſelfe, and mine own eyes ſhal behold, after that my reines, with my boſome<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſhall be conſumed.</hi> Elſe it could be no Reſurrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, vnleſſe the very ſame bodies did ariſe.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Two things are to bee conſidered proper to the Elect: for</p>
               <p>Firſt, They ſhall riſe glorious, like to the glorified bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die<note place="margin">glorious,</note> of our Sauiour Chriſt. In which reſpect it is ſaid, <hi>They ſhall</hi> 
                  <note n="o" place="margin">Mat. 13. 43.</note> 
                  <hi>ſhine as the Sunne.</hi> And the Apoſtle ſaith, <note n="*" place="margin">1. Co. 15. 42, 43</note> 
                  <hi>It is ſowne a bodie, ſubiect to corruption, it is rayſed incorrupt: it ſowne diſhonorable, it is rayſed glorious: it is ſowne weake, it is rayſed powerful.</hi> And afterwards,
<note n="p" place="margin">Verſe 47, &amp;c</note> 
                  <hi>The firſt man from the Earth, the ſecond Man, the Lord from Heauen: ſuch as the earthy one was, ſuch alſo are the earthly men: and ſuch as the heauenly one is, ſuch alſo ſhal the heauenly ones be. And as we haue carryed the image of the earthy one ſo alſo ſhall we carrie the Image of the heauenly One. Coloſſ. 3. 4. When Chriſt ſhal be manifeſted, which is our life, then ſhal ye alſo be manifeſted with him glorious. Phil. 3. 21. Who wil transforme this our baſe bodie, that it may be faſhioned like to his glorious body, wherby he is able to ſubiect all things vnto himſelfe.</hi> So as they ſhal not any more be quickned by meat or drink, or the vſe of outward things, but by the onely participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Power of Chriſts Spirit: whereupon they are called <note n="q" place="margin">1. Cor. 15. 44.</note> 
                  <hi>Spirituall bodies,</hi> liuing onely by the Power of Chriſts Spirit immediately quickening them for euer: as thoſe we carrie now about vs, are called naturall bodies, becauſe they liue by naturall meanes, and the power of the foule that quickeneth them, which is another thing, wherein our ſtate is bettered in Chriſt, aboue that it was in <hi>Adam;</hi> whoſe bodie, though it were comely and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull, yet was not glorious, as ours ſhall bee being glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified through Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, This is done by the ſpeciall Power and Vertue of his Reſurrection, whoſe members they are,
<pb n="528" facs="tcp:29324:278"/> and in <note n="r" place="margin">Epheſ. 2. 6.</note> whome, and together with whome, when hee aroſe from the dead, all the Church did riſe. Wherefore the
<note n="ſ" place="margin">1. Theſ. 4. 14.</note> Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>If we beleeue that Ieſus is dead and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen againe, ſo alſo will God bring together with him thoſe that ſlept, through Ieſus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And hereupon, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 20, 21, 22. hee calleth him, <hi>The firſt fruits of the dead,</hi> who in and by his riſing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, hath ſanctified the Reſurrection of all his: <hi>For as by man came death: ſo alſo by Man commeth the Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction from the dead; for as in</hi> ADAM <hi>al dyed, ſo alſo in Chriſt ſhall all be quickened:</hi> that is, all the faithfull, of whom he there ſpeaketh: for the Reprobate he doth not rayſe vp (as hee doth the Elect, whoſe Head he is) by vertue of his owne Reſurrection, but onely the force of that curſe, (<note n="t" place="margin">Gen. 2. 17,</note> 
                  <hi>What Day thou eateſt of the forbidden fruit, thou ſhalt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly dye</hi>) ſhall reſtore to them their bodies, wherein to ſuffer euerlaſting torments. Whence it is, that this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of theirs out of the Graue (being onely vnto death) is ſcarce vouchſafed in the Scripture the name of a Reſurrection, whereas to GODS Children, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one principall part of their redeeming and freeing into euerlaſting Glorie, it hath the name of <hi>Regeneration</hi> giuen to it, <hi>Mat.</hi> 19. 28. for this cauſe it is alſo called, <note n="u" place="margin">Luke 14. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>The Reſurrection of the Righteous,</hi> and they named <hi>Children of the</hi>

                  <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> for that the fruit and comfort of the Reſurrection doth properly and onely appertayne to them. In the laſt Iudgement I note,</p>
               <p>Firſt, Who ſhall bee iudged. All, both Deuils and<note place="margin">the whole man ſhall meete</note> men, as it is ſaid, <note n="y" place="margin">Rom. 14. 10. &amp; 1. Cor. 5. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>All of vs muſt be preſented before the Iudgement Seat of Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And of the Angels that fell, the Apoſtle ſaith, <note n="z" place="margin">1. Cor. 5. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>Know ye not, that wee ſhall iudge the Angel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>Secondly, Who ſhalbe the Iudge. Euen Chriſt, who<note place="margin">Chriſt</note>
                  <note n="b" place="margin">Acts 10. 42.</note> 
                  <hi>is appointed of God the Iudge of the liuing &amp; dead.</hi> Chriſt Ieſus, I ſay, God and Man appearing in his Man-hood
<pb n="529" facs="tcp:29324:278"/> viſible &amp; to be ſeene in the fleſh: <note n="c" place="margin">Acts 17. 31.</note> 
                  <hi>For hee hath ſet a Day</hi> (ſaith PAVL, <hi>wherein hee will iudge the World in Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, by the Man whom hee hath appointed:</hi> The Father nor Holy Ghoſt ſhall not appeare.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The comming of this Iudge. Wherein I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue<note place="margin">comming to Iudgement,</note> foure circumſtances:</p>
               <p>Firſt, The place from whence hee ſhall come, as wee reade, <hi>This</hi>
                  <note n="d" place="margin">Acts 1. 11.</note> IESVS <hi>who is taken vp from you into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, ſhall ſo come from Heauen, as yee haue beheld him go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into Heauen.</hi>
                  <note n="e" place="margin">2. Theſſ. 1. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>When the Lord</hi> IESVS CHRIST <hi>ſhall be reuealed from Heauen with his mightie Angels.</hi> 
                  <note n="f" place="margin">1. Theſſ. 4. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>The Lord himſelfe with a ſhowting ſhall come downe from Heauen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, The time of his comming: the Day and houre whereof is vncertaine:
<note n="g" place="margin">Mat. 24. 36.</note> 
                  <hi>Of that Day or houre</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>knoweth no man, no, not the Angels of Heauen, but my Father onely:</hi> and as another
<note n="h" place="margin">Marke 13. 32</note> Euangeliſt hath it, <hi>nor the Sonne himſelfe:</hi> meaning, as hee is the Mediatour of his Church, and not as hee is God equall with his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, As earthly Princes haue ſundry States to goe before them in great brauerie and oſtentation, to giue warning of their comming, and at length followeth the Prince with all his Nobles: So this King of Kings ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth before him certayne glorious ſignes and foreto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens of his Comming, before hee himſelfe doe come. Theſe Signes you ſhall finde all recorded, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. of which Chapter (ſo much thereof as appertayneth to this purpoſe) it ſhall not bee amiſſe, before wee goe fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to make ſome ſhort <hi>Analyſis</hi> or reſolution, both for the excellencie of the matter, and to cleere ſome diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties in the paſſage: for I know, it is commonly taken, that ſome of thoſe tokens are immediately vpon his Comming, and as it were, at his ſetting forth; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the truth is, the very neereſt of them is at the leaſt ſome Age of yeeres before, as appeareth, <hi>Verſe</hi> 33, 34.</p>
               <p>To come therefore to the foure and twentieth of <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew,</hi>
                  <pb n="530" facs="tcp:29324:279"/> our Sauiour hauing finiſhed the Signes of <hi>Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lems ouerthrow,</hi> in the firſt 22. Verſes of the Chapter, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth in the 23. Verſe, to enter vpon thoſe that were to fore-runne his Comming vnto Iudgement, whereof hee mentioneth foure of all other the greateſt and moſt me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable.</p>
               <p>The firſt is the Kingdome of Poperie: where, ſee how hee painteth out the Romiſh Synagogue euen in her co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours.</p>
               <p>Firſt, It is a Church in ſhew and ſemblance; elſe <hi>falſe chriſts and falſe prophets</hi> could not be ſpoken of: but yet in truth it is no Church at all: <hi>For if any man</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſhall ſay vnto you, Lo, heere is Chriſt, or there, beleeue it not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, They ſhall ſay, <hi>Here is Chriſt, and there is Christ.</hi> Notably verified in the Popiſh Maſſe, which (to make it appeare to all the World, that they are of the number of theſe falſe prophets) proclaymeth Chriſt to be really in the Sacraments.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, It is a perſecuting Church. So he ſaith, Verſe 29. <hi>Immediately after the affliction of thoſe dayes.</hi> Therein comprehending the whole Antichriſtian Tyrannie.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Of this Church, Antichriſt is the head, whoſe whole ſucceſſion he termeth <hi>Falſe chriſts, and falſe prophets.</hi> Not ſuch falſe chriſts as hee ſpeaketh of with another manner of ſtyle, Verſe 5. which ſhould ſay, <hi>I am Chriſt,</hi> falſly belying his very Perſon: but that great ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducer and falſe prophet, who, vnder the Name of Chriſts Vicar, and <hi>Peters</hi> Succeſſour, ſhould iuſtle Chriſt out of his Chaire.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, The Armes, Legges and Shoulders of it, or the Tayle rather, (for the Sting and Poyſon of theſe Scorpions is in their Tayle) are a Rabble of falſe teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, <hi>Falſe prophets,</hi> as he termeth them.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, By theſe falſe teachers, are wrought a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of falſe and fayned miracles.</p>
               <pb n="531" facs="tcp:29324:279"/>
               <p>Seuenthly, The bodie is their Romiſh catholike, apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaticall Church, ſeduced by ſuch falſe teachers, and by thoſe lying ſignes and miracles.</p>
               <p>How maruellouſly doe theſe things iumpe with that which we finde recorded in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Theſſaloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> and by <hi>Iohn</hi> in the <hi>Reuelation?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They ſhall,</hi> ſaith Chriſt heere, <hi>worke great Signes and Wonders, inſomuch as they ſhould deceiue, if it were poſſible, the very Elect.</hi> So ſaith
<note n="i" place="margin">2. Theſſ. 2. 9, 10, 11.</note> PAVL, <hi>Whoſe comming ſhall be by the effectuall working of Satan, with all power, and ſignes, and lying wonders, and with all deceitfulneſſe of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie in them that periſh, &amp;c. Therefore God ſhall ſend them effectuall errours, to beleeue lyes.</hi> And in the <note n="k" place="margin">Reuel. 13. 12, 13, 14.</note> 
                  <hi>Reuelation he maketh the Earth and the Inhabitants thereof to worſhip the firſt Beaſt, and worketh great ſignes, inſomuch as he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth fire come downe from Heauen vnto the Earth before men, and deceiueth the Inhabitants of the Earth, by the ſignes which were giuen to him to doe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe are the ſignes and wonders which the Papiſts ſo bragge of, and make one ſpeciall marke of their Church, as <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niuerſalitie,</hi> that is, their vniuerſall Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſie here alſo mentioned, is another.</p>
               <p>Theſe ſeuen are in the 23. and 24. Verſes.</p>
               <p>Eighthly, The errour and ſuperſtition of the times, placing all Religion and Chriſtianitie in the Wildernes among the <hi>Eremites,</hi> or in their Monkiſh Cels and Cloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters: Againſt which hee armeth vs with a double argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: firſt, <note n="l" place="margin">
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>erſe 27.</note> The Light, ſaith he, of the Goſpell (that he meaneth by <hi>the Comming of the Sonne of Man,</hi> as it is taken much in the ſame ſence, 2. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. 8.) is as the Lightening, which flaſheth from the Eaſt to the Weſt, and lighteneth all the World: So doth the Goſpell not the Deſarts and Cloyſters onely, but, in euery place, <hi>He that feareth God and worketh Righteouſneſſe, is accepted of him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Againe, as the <note n="m" place="margin">Verſe 28.</note> Eagles (or with vs, Crowes and Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens)

               <p>And ſo, ninthly and laſtly, deliuering a moſt certayne and infallible note of the true Church, hee giueth a Bill of Diuorce to the Romiſh Synagogue, that holdeth not Chriſt the Head, nor Iuſtification by Faith alone in his bloud.</p>
               <p>Thus haue wee in the whole a liuely deſcription of the Romiſh Catholike Church; which for the ROMANISTS better helpe, may out of this place bee defined thus: <hi>The Romiſh Catholike Church is a cruell perſecuting Church, whereof Chriſts <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>icar (falſly ſo named) is the head: multitude of falſe teachers, and a whole World of miſ-beleeuers, by lying miracles deceiuing and deceiued, make the bodie, which ſeeke Christ vpon the Earth in their Sacrament of the Altar, place Religion in an Ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miticall, or Monkiſh life; not holding Chriſt the Head, nor Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification by Faith alone in his bloud: And therefore are not the Church of Chriſt, but the Synagogue of Satan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond ſigne is, that <note n="o" place="margin">Verſe 29.</note> 
                  <hi>The Heauen ſhall be dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, The Moone ſhall not giue her Light, the Starres ſhall fall from Heauen, and the powers of Heauen</hi> (or powerfull and potent Heauens) <hi>ſhall be ſhaken.</hi> Such Metaphors as theſe, the Scripture is wont to vſe, when it would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe a notable change to fall out in the World, the ruine and ouerthrow of ſome great State or Monarchie.

               <p>Secondly, The glorie of their Church two wayes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed; one, by calling it, <hi>The Signe of the Sonne of man:</hi> the other, <hi>The Comming of the Sonne of man in the Clouds of the Heauen:</hi> for ſo is the latter vſed, <hi>Reue.</hi> 1. 7 And before in this Chapter, Verſe 27. and they both import the ſelfe ſame thing which <hi>Paul, 2.

                  <hi>The brightneſſe of his Comming:</hi> to wit, not a corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, but a ſpirituall Comming, powerfully and royally in the great and glorious Conuerſion of this Nation.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The generalitie of their call, that <hi>all the Tribes of Iſrael, aſwell as Iudah,</hi> ſhall bee ſaued. Which very word of Tribes, if there were no more, ſheweth of what people it muſt be meant.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Their true and vnfayned Repentance: for the mourning heere ſpoken of, is that bitter mourning for the ſinne of all ſinnes, the ſinne of refuſing Chriſt, whereof you reade, <hi>Zacharie 12. 10, 11, &amp;c. Reu.</hi> 1. 7.</p>
               <p>The fourth Signe, is the generall publiſhing of the Goſpell thorowout the World: for this ſending of his Angels with a Trumpet, and great voyce, and their ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering of the Elect out of the foure Windes, from one end of the Heauen to another, Verſe 31. cannot bee that voyce of an Archangell, and Trumpet of God, which the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of, 1. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4. 16. nor the gathering mentioned, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 32. for it is expreſly ſaid here, Verſe 33, 34. <hi>When you ſee all thoſe things</hi> (whereof this which we now ſpeake of, is one) <hi>know hee is neere at the doores</hi> (not yet come, as he muſt be, when the Archangels voice doth ſound.) <hi>Verily I ſay vnto you, The ſame</hi>

               <p>Fourthly, With infinite thouſands of holy Angels to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend vpon him, <hi>Mat. 25. 31. When the Son of man ſhall come in his glorie, &amp; all his holy Angels with him. 2. Theſ. 1. 7. When the Lord Ieſus ſhal ſhew himſelfe from Heauen with his migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie Angels.</hi> For the bleſſed ſoules of the righteous decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, ſhall not attend him when hee commeth to Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but ſhall bee ſent to their bodies in the Graues, from thence to be taken vp and preſented before him.</p>
               <p>The fourth thing to bee obſerued in the laſt Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,<note place="margin">in the Ayre, and there</note> is the place where the ſame ſhall bee: which the <note n="t" place="margin">1.

               <p>Next, are the things, which hee ſhall doe when hee is come, being of three ſorts:</p>
               <p>Firſt, The preparation to the Sentence.</p>
               <p>This ſtandeth in foure things:</p>
               <p>Firſt, The erecting of a great and glorious Throne for this Iudge to ſit vpon; though of what matter the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture concealeth, yet (vndoubtedly) fit for the Maieſtie of the Iudge of all the World; whether the ſame be the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Angels of God, that as a Throne beare vp our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Chriſt, or ſome other thing: but for certayne, a reall, and moſt Royall Place it ſhall be, where hee ſhall ſit euidently to bee ſeene of all, <hi>Mat. 19. 28. When the Sonne of man ſhall ſit vpon his glorious Throne. Reuel. 20. 11. I ſaw a great white Throne, and one ſitting vpon it; great,</hi> to ſhew the Maieſtie; and <hi>white,</hi> to note the ſinceritie and vprightneſſe of his Iudgement.</p>
               <pb n="537" facs="tcp:29324:282"/>
               <p>Secondly, His retinue and attendants, which are the troupes and thouſand thouſands of holy Angels com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſing him about.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The gathering together of all both Elect and Reprobate, to come before him.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The ſeparating of thoſe two ſorts one from the other, ſetting the Elect at his right hand, and the Reprobate at his left hand. You ſhall finde them all foure, <hi>Mat. 25. 31, 32, 33. And when the Sonne of man commeth in his glorie, and all the holy Angels with him, then ſhall hee ſit vpon the Throne of his glorie: And before him ſhall be gathered all Nations, and he ſhall ſeparate one from another, as the Shepheard ſeparateth the Sheepe from the Goates, and he ſhall ſet the Sheepe at his right hand, and the Goates on his left.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond thing which he ſhall doe, being come, is<note place="margin">receiue ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of all fulnes of bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſednes for euer:</note> the ſentencing or proceeding vnto Iudgement.</p>
               <p>Wherein I conſider,</p>
               <p>Firſt, The order of the Sentence, that firſt it ſhall bee pronounced vpon the Elect, then, againſt the Reprobate: for ſo our Sauiour manifeſtly ſheweth, <hi>Mat. 25. 34. Then</hi> (aſſoone as ſeparation is made) <hi>the King ſhall ſay to them at his right hand,</hi> And, <note n="u" place="margin">Verſe 41.</note> 
                  <hi>Then</hi> (afterwards) <hi>he ſhall alſo ſay to them at his left hand.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This appeareth further by that honour that the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God ſhall haue to iudge the wicked, iuſtifying and approouing, by their voyce and ſuffrage, the holy Sentence of Chriſt; which, becauſe it cannot bee, vntill themſelues haue receiued the ſentence of glorie, it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, that the ſame goeth in order before the other.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The ſentence <note n="x" place="margin">Mat. 25. 34, 41.</note> it ſelfe; to the Elect, <hi>Come, yee bleſſed of my Father, inherit the Kingdome prepared for you from the foundation of the World.</hi> To the Reprobate, <hi>Depart from me, ye curſed, into euerlaſting fire, prepared for the Deuill and his angels.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, The <note n="y" place="margin">Mat. 25. 4, 34, 35, 36, 41, 42 43.</note> reaſon of the Sentence, iuſtifying
<pb n="538" facs="tcp:29324:283"/> this great Iudge before God and the World, and to the conſciences of all men: for in it is opened firſt the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall and moſt righteous Decree of God, electing one, and reprobating the other. Then the ſequels of this E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection and Reprobation: In the Elect, Loue to Chriſt and to his members; vndoubted fruits and teſtimonies of their Faith: in the Reprobate, hardneſſe of heart, without compaſſion or loue vnto the Saints; a declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion before men and to their owne ſoules of their righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous and iuſt perdition. <hi>Iohn</hi> in the <note n="z" place="margin">Reuel. 20. 21.</note> 
                  <hi>Reuelation</hi> doth elegantly deſcribe it by two Bookes, wherein thoſe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are both written: The firſt is, The Booke of both their conſciences, wherein are written the ones wicked workes, to conuince their damnation to be moſt iuſt, and the others Holineſſe of conuerſation. The other Booke is, The Booke of Life, which is the eternall Election of the latter; to ſhew that they, being many times guiltie of foule offences, and the beſt of all their workes weake and imperfect, and vtterly of no deſert, their Saluation is altogether free, and of Gods meere grace and fauour, in and through Chriſt.</p>
               <p>The third is, The Execution of this Sentence, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with<note place="margin">which</note> our Sauiour ſhutteth vp, <hi>Mat. 25. 46. So theſe ſhall goe away vnto euerlaſting puniſhment, but the righteous vnto life euerlaſting.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wherein we conſider the order of it, and the thing it ſelfe.</p>
               <p>The order, firſt, vpon the Reprobate, then, to the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect: for albeit the Sentence of <hi>Come, yee bleſſed,</hi> for ſuch cauſes as we haue heard alreadie, bee in order to goe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that of, <hi>Goe yee curſed, &amp;c.</hi> yet the Execution be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth heere, the holy
<note n="a" place="margin">Mat. 13. 49, 50.</note> Angels firſt of all flying at once vpon the Reprobate, to throw them into the place of their deſerued torment, that ſo the ioy of the Elect may bee the fuller, when in the view and eye-ſight of their miſerie, themſelues, together with Chriſt their
<pb n="539" facs="tcp:29324:283"/> Head, ſhall triumphantly aſcend to Heauen: And this to be no vain nor idle fantaſie, but a doctrine of great fruit, and worthy to be ſtood vpon, the very order of Chriſts owne words enforceth, ſo marſhalling the Execution.</p>
               <p>The thing it ſelfe; that the whole man, ſoule and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,<note place="margin">we ſhall enioy, taken vp into Heauen by the vertue of his Aſcenſion.</note> after this Sentence, is taken vp into Heauen, by the vertue of him that hath entred Heauen for vs, and ſhall there enioy the higheſt top and fulneſſe of all perfection for euermore. Wherefore here many things may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued, common for the moſt part to both degrees of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, but which I ſaid for greater comfort ſhould ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally bee reſerued hither. I will reduce them all to foure heads. The place where wee ſhall enioy it: the glorie we ſhall enioy: the meaſure of the glorie: and the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of it. This happineſſe is to be had in Heauen, which addeth no ſmall increaſe to the fulneſſe of ioy, which the Elect are then to haue, both in regard of the excellencie of the Place, whereof wee haue ſpoken before, being that Bleſſed and Glorious Seate on high, the Palace of the great King, of <note n="b" place="margin">John 14. 2.</note> large receit, and goodly dwelling Roomes, and alſo by reaſon of thoſe great and glorious things that are no where to be had but there, to wit, the preſence of Chriſt, the companie and fellowſhip of the <note n="c" place="margin">Mat. 8. 11.</note> Saints and holy
<note n="d" place="margin">Heb. 12. 22.</note> Angels, and of thoſe great Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies whereof the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, <hi>Heb. 12. 23.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The right wee haue of comming to this Place, is by the vertue of Chriſts Aſcenſion, as hee ſaith, <note n="e" place="margin">Iohn 14. 23. &amp; Iohn 16. 17.</note> 
                  <hi>I goe to prepare a place for you.</hi> So <hi>Luke</hi> 23. 43. hee maketh the vertue and power of his being in Paradiſe, to bee the cauſe of the Theeues comming thither, <hi>To day thou ſhalt be with me in Paradiſe:</hi> for this aſcending of CHRISTS, though it were in the end of the World, was of power ſufficient to open Heauen to all Beleeuers, from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning; and vpon his aſcending, all the <note n="f" place="margin">
                     <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </note> Church in him, as in their Head, aſcended with him. Therefore it is, that vpon his Inauguration to his Office, the Heauens o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened,
<pb n="540" facs="tcp:29324:284"/> which before were ſhut againſt the ſonnes of men. This was figured in the Types of the Law, by the <note n="g" place="margin">Heb. 9. 24.</note> Prieſts entring into the moſt Holy Place; to ſhew that Chriſt ſhould goe into Heauen it ſelfe, to appeare there in the fleſh, that we might come thither after him.</p>
               <p>Whereof I gather a fourth prerogatiue, which wee haue through the imputation of Chriſts Righteouſneſſe, aboue that that was in <hi>Adam,</hi> or that our owne Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe in the greateſt perfection of it could poſſibly bring vs to: of earthly Creatures, and dwellers in Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of Clay, to make vs heauenly Creatures, and Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens of the new <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> which is aboue.</p>
               <p>To declare this ſomewhat more largely; It is the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of Chriſts Righteouſneſſe, by which alone wee may lay clayme to the Kingdome of Heauen: for man was created an earthly Creature; and though he had all the Righteouſneſſe that his nature might reach vnto, yet he could neuer challenge Heauen by it, but his Happines was to be all vpon Earth, which was his proper Element wherein God had ſet him, and <hi>Adams</hi> Paradiſe was a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtriall dwelling, where he inioyed as much Happineſſe, as he might expect or looke for; neither was hee to paſſe the bounds that GOD had ſet, in coue<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ing after the Kingdome of Heauen, and to bee an Aſſociate among the Bleſſed Angels, but to content him with his portion here below, being the fulneſſe of all ioy that his nature could receiue. So that if our Sauiour Chriſt had onely dyed for the Remiſſion of ſinnes, though he had thereby made vs as righteous in our ſelues, as euer <hi>Adam</hi> was, yet could wee not thereby clayme to haue any part in Heauen: But our Sauiour beſtowing withall a Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe vpon vs, farre aboue the Righteouſneſſe of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, being the Righteouſneſſe of his owne perſon who was both God and Man; as he himſelfe merited Heauen, and the fulneſſe of all Glorie there: ſo by that meanes our right alſo commeth, of being where our Head is.

The Bleſſedneſſe it ſelfe is to be conſidered, both in the Roote and in the Branches of it. The Root and Wel-Spring of all our Happineſſe, is this, that in as much as we ſhall be ioyned in Spirituall Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage vnto Chriſt, we ſhal in his humane nature be eſpou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and made one perſon with God, and thereby more neerly ioyned vnto him, then either <hi>Adam</hi> was in his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency, or the Angels are in Heauen: Euen as the wife is more neerly ioyned to the Husband, then is Father, or Mother, or other friend: all whom hee muſt forſake, to cleane vnto his Wife.

               </p>
               <p>From this Power and Rule two things proceed.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That together with Chriſt our Head, wee ſhall iudge the World, aſwell the Angels that fell, as repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate and wicked men, 1. <hi>Cor. 6. 2. Know yee not that the Saints ſhall iudge the World?</hi> And againe, <hi>

               <p>Secondly, That wee ſhall be made the heires of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen and Earth, in and through him, <hi>Who</hi> as the <note n="n" place="margin">Heb. 1. 2.</note> Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſaith, <hi>is made heire of all things. 1. Pet. 1. 4. Who hath begotten vs anew vnto an Heritance, incorruptible and vnde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed, which cannot fade away, reſerued in Heauen for vs. Reuel at. 21. 7. Hee that ouercommeth, ſhall inherit theſe things.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, The glorie and excellencie that then ſhalbe in our Knowledge, Memorie and all other parts and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, as you haue it ſet forth, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 13, 11, 12. Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as there is no doubt wee ſhall know one another: for hereby our Sauiour ſetteth forth the ſtate of the Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, <hi>Mat.</hi> 17. 3, 4.</p>
               <pb n="543" facs="tcp:29324:285"/>
               <p>Wee come now to the meaſure or quantitie of theſe good things, albeit not infinite, yet wonderfull, ſuch as no man knoweth but God, and hee <note n="o" place="margin">Eſay 64. 4.</note> that doth enioy them, which is the third benefit that we haue by Chriſt, aboue that which was in <hi>Adam,</hi> who lacking that ſweet coniunction, which wee haue with Chriſt, from whom, as from our Head, his owne very Bleſſedneſſe is deriued downe vnto vs, could not haue the good things that were in him, to be ſo great and excellent.</p>
               <p>In the meaſure of our happineſſe, two things are to be obſerued: The one, proper to this eſtate, that the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of it, after the laſt Iudgement, exceedeth that which our ſoules, ſeparated from our bodies, had before: for when the Soules of the Martyrs ſlaine for the Word of God, and the teſtimonie of Ieſus, (if at the leaſt you vnderſtand that place of the ſoules deceaſed) cry, <hi>How long, O Lord, holy and true! Wilt not thou iudge and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge our bloud of the Inhabitants of the Earth? And it was anſwered them, that they must reſt a while, till the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of their fellow<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſeruants and brethren bee filled vp, which ſhould be killed aſwell as they:</hi> it ſheweth, that their full reſt is not yet accompliſhed. To this purpoſe it ſerueth, that the generall Iudgement of all the dead, is termed, <hi>A time of giuing a reward to Gods ſeruants the Prophets, and to the Saints, and to all that feare his Name:</hi> As not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing yet the full reward that is promiſed in that Day; whereunto Gods Children lift vp their head, as to the top and perfection of all their comfort. <hi>Hereafter</hi> (ſaith PAVL) <hi>is layd vp for mee a Crowne of Glorie, which God the righteous Iudge will render in that Day.</hi> And the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet DAVID, <hi>I, when I awake,</hi> that is, riſe from the dead in the Reſurrection of the righteous, <hi>ſhall bee ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with thy likeneſſe.</hi> IOHN alſo referreth our full per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection vnto that time, <hi>When hee</hi> (that is, Chriſt) <hi>ſhall bee manifested, we ſhall bee like vnto him.</hi> And hither tendeth the ſpeech of the Apoſtle, <hi>That his Spirit may bee ſaued
<pb n="544" facs="tcp:29324:286"/> in the Day of the</hi> LORD IESVS CHRIST.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is, that beſide the Happineſſe common to them all, there are ſome which ſhall haue ioy aboue their fellowes: Not that this argueth any want in thoſe that haue leſſe; for though all receiue not alike mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, yet all ſhall bee full; As a Veſſell contayning a Gallon, is as full for the bigneſſe, as that which contay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth ten.</p>
               <p>And this difference groweth from the diuers meaſure of Faith, which God in this life doth indue vs with: for Faith, as wee heard before, is that which ioyneth vs to Chriſt: And as our Faith groweth, ſo are wee more deeply and firmely rooted and built in him: The grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter therefore that our Faith is, the neerer and the ſtraigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is our coniunction with Chriſt; and the neerer wee are knit to him, the greater our glorie and excellencie muſt bee. And becauſe our Faith is diſcerned by the fruits; great faith, many fruits; ſmall faith, few fruits: thereof it is, that for the moſt part wee ſee the meaſure of Happineſſe aſcribed to the multitude and qualitie of the fruits. 1. <hi>Corinth. 3. 8. Euery one ſhall receiue his owne proper reward, according to his owne proper labour, Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip. 4. 17. I deſire a fruit that may abound in your account.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To giue a taſte of ſome that are noted in the Scripture thus to excell, though it hold not in euery particular perſon, yet generally theſe ſorts and eſtates are obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued:</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Thoſe that inſtruct others, ſhall ſhine as the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the Firmament, and thoſe that iuſtifie many:</hi> that is, are the good Inſtruments of God to bring men to Chriſt, <hi>ſhall be as the ſtarres, Dan.</hi> 12. 3.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The Maſter-builder that planteth and lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the foundation, ſhall haue greater glorie then he that watereth and buildeth thereupon, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 8, 10.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>The Martyr ſhall bee made a</hi>

               <pb n="545" facs="tcp:29324:286"/>
               <p>The laſt thing, is the<note place="margin">Chiliaſtes, which place happines after the Reſurrection, in the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of the bodie and vpon the Earth, and that to indure but for a thouſand yeeres, abuſing the place, <hi>Reuel. 20. 4. They raigned with Chriſt a thouſand yeeres,</hi> which is not to bee vnderſtood of the condition of the Elect after this life, but in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent World, during all that time that Satan by the Miniſterie of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell ſhould be bound that he might not deceiue the Nations, which was very neere a thouſand yeeres after Chriſt, all which time ſome truth remayned in the Churches, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the maine points of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Doctrine.</note> eternitie and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of our Happines: As it is ſaid, <note n="q" place="margin">1.

                  <hi>They ſhall raigne for euer and euer.</hi> And <note n="ſ" place="margin">1. Pet. 1. 4.</note>

Cor. 5. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>immortalitie being ſallowed vp of life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That all muſt dye, and all thus riſe againe, is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon<note place="margin">Certaine men vpon our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Chriſts Reſurrection roſe againe, and are alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy with him in Heauen.</note> condition of all Mankind, ſome few excepted, and thoſe of three ſorts: for</p>
               <p>Firſt, Some there were, who being dead, vpon our Sauiour Chriſts Reſurrection roſe againe, and are alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die with him in glorie. Of whom you may reade, <hi>Mat. 27. 52, 53. that the graues did open themſelues, and many bodies of the Saints which ſlept, aroſe, and came out of the Graues after his Reſurrection, and went into the holy Citie, and appeared vnto many.</hi> Which word (<hi>appearing</hi>) ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that they did not riſe, to conuerſe among men, or to dye againe, as <hi>Lazarus</hi> and ſome other did, but in their owne perſons to attend vpon him in his Aſcenſion vnto Heauen, and by their Reſurrection, to ſeale vp the truth of his and of ours, in and through him; that ſo not onely in Chriſt our Head, but in our Brethren and fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-members, full aſſurance might bee made vnto vs
<pb n="546" facs="tcp:29324:287"/> of this ſweete and comfortable Doctrine.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Other there were that neuer dyed, but<note place="margin">So are <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> both aliue aſſumed thither.</note> onely changed their miſerable condition into Glorie &amp; Immortalitie, and ſo were taken vp aliue into Heauen. And this was the peculiar priuiledge of <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Elias:</hi> One, before the Law; another vnder the Law: both in moſt corrupt and depraued times, wherein the ſincere worſhip of God was no<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> where to bee found, the hope of eternall Life, and of the Reſurrection to come, vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly loſt and gone. God therefore, to leaue a plentifull teſtimonie of a bleſſed Reſurrection, till the cleerer ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation of it by the riſing of his Sonne, and both to giue teſtimonie of the Faith and Pietie of ſuch men, and to conuince the wicked World of Infidelitie, ſuffered not thoſe two to goe the way of all fleſh, but by a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall fauour did aſſume them bodie and ſoule vnto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe: thereby alſo to make them types and figures of the Reſurrection of his Sonne, by whoſe power they thus eſcaped death.</p>
               <p>Of <hi>Enoch,</hi> firſt, it is recorded, <hi>Gen. 5. 24. That he wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king with God three thouſand yeers</hi> (in which time, as <note n="u" place="margin">Iude ver. 24.</note> 
                  <hi>Iude</hi> the Apoſtle witneſſeth, hee diligently executed the part of a faithfull Teacher in Gods Church, reproouing the corrupt World of ſin, &amp; denouncing Gods ſeuere Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments againſt them, euen to the extreme curſe of <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thema Maranatha</hi> in the end, <hi>hee was no more ſeene: for God tooke him:</hi> that is, as the <note n="x" place="margin">Heb. 11. 5.</note> Apoſtle to the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> doth expound it, <hi>did tranſlate him that hee ſhould not ſee death.</hi> And of <hi>Elias</hi> the Storie is ſet forth at large, in the firſt and ſecond Booke of <hi>Kings:</hi> How after long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts with <hi>Achab</hi> the King of Iſrael, and <hi>Ieſabel</hi> his wife, and with foure hundred and fiftie prophets, the prieſts of <hi>Baal</hi> at once, being toſſed (as wee ſay) from Poſt to Pillar, and driuen to flye for his life, hauing reſtored the true Worſhip of God, and reedified his Altars that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore were throwne downe &amp; deſtroyed, &amp; being now, as
<pb n="547" facs="tcp:29324:287"/> hee thought, left alone and wearie of his life, God in the end, after his many labours, <note n="y" place="margin">2. Kings 2. 23</note> tooke him vp in a whirle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>winde into Heauen: Thereby conuincing the Idolatry of that Age. And when in the Towne of <hi>Bethel,</hi> where the Calues were erected, and Idolatrie and Superſtition ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, they made a Scoffe of this Aſcenſion, and taught their children ſo to doe, ſaying, to <hi>Eliſha</hi> in ſcoffing ſort, <hi>Aſcend, Bald-pate, aſcend Bald-pate,</hi> that is, Goe vp to Heauen as <hi>Elias</hi> did: as if they ſhould haue ſaid, A pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and goodly aſcenſion: two Beares comming out of the Forreſt, tare in pieces two &amp; forty children of them. And that this was alwayes the iudgement of the Church, concerning <hi>Elias,</hi> may appeare, <hi>Luke</hi> 9. 8. where in the diuerſitie of opinions held of our Sauiour Chriſt, ſome ſaid, that IOHN <hi>was rayſed from the dead;</hi> ſome, that ELIAS <hi>had appeared;</hi> other, <hi>that one of the old Prophets was riſen againe.</hi> To all the reſt attributing Reſurrection, as of bodies dead, onely to ELIAS <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parition,</hi> in the truth of his humane nature, as of one that neuer dyed.</p>
               <p>Two things there bee that may ſeeme to croſſe this Doctrine: One, that Chriſt is called, <hi>The firſt fruites of them that ſleepe, 1. Cor.</hi> 15. 20. The other, that in the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth to the <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 39. the Apoſtle ſpeaking of the holy men of God before the Comming of Chriſt: And of <hi>Enoch</hi> among the reſt, ſaith of them all, that <hi>they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued not the promiſes.</hi> But hereunto it may bee anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that the promiſe which the Apoſtle meaneth, is the manifeſtation of Chriſt <hi>in the fleſh,</hi> and the more plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full meaſure of grace now, then was before his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, which pertayneth nothing to this queſtion. As for that, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. Chriſt is called, <hi>The firſt fruits of them that ſleepe,</hi> becauſe by the power of his Reſurrection all ſhall riſe againe, and his Reſurrection ſanctifieth ours, as the firſt fruits did the whole crop; not that he of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie muſt be the firſt that roſe, no more then hee was the
<pb n="548" facs="tcp:29324:288"/> firſt whoſe ſoule did enter Heauen: though all both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and ſince haue entred by his power: Although, if you ſhould ſo farre preſſe this Phraſe, Chriſt was indeed the firſt that roſe, ſeeing to ſpeake properly, <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> neuer dyed, and therefore neuer roſe. And how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer it bee an extraordinarie Example, in one or two ſpeciall perſons, it ſerueth not to ouerthrow a generall truth: But the firſt I take to be the Apoſtles meaning.</p>
               <p>Yet haue not theſe two ſorts their full glorie alreadie: for<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> howſoeuer their whole nature bee made perfect, yet the fulneſſe of their perfection is deferred till the latter Day, as to the reſt of Gods Elect: Euen as wee ſee, the whole ſpirituall nature of the Angels that fell, is now fully accurſed, and yet reſerued for a more full damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>The third ſort, are thoſe men that the Comming of<note place="margin">Thoſe that are liuing at the latter Day, ſhall ſuddenly be changed, after the dead are once riſen.</note> Chriſt doth finde aliue, who ſhall not dye, but ſhall ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly bee changed, as <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> were; and ſo bee taken vp to meete Chriſt, after that the dead in him ſhall be firſt riſen. <hi>All of vs,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, 1. <hi>Cor. 15. 51, 52. ſhall not ſleepe, but all of vs ſhall be changed, in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the laſt Trumpet: for the Trumpet ſhall ſound, and the dead ſhall riſe vp without corruption, and we ſhall be changed.</hi> And againe, 1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Theſſ. 4. 15, 16, 17. This ſay we to you in the Word of the Lord, that we which liue, and are remayning in the Comming of the Lord, ſhall not preuent them which ſleepe: for the Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ſhall come downe from Heauen, and the dead in Chriſt ſhall ariſe firſt, afterwards, ſhall we which liue and remayne, be caught vp alſo with them in the Clouds, to meete the Lord in the Ayre.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By the Analogie of which places wee are to gather, that to the Reprobate alſo which are then liuing, there ſhall bee a miſerable and wretched change of their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, which ſhall be in ſtead of death.</p>
               <pb n="549" facs="tcp:29324:288"/>
               <p>This is further to be added, touching the Reſurrection<note place="margin">The creatures alſo for our ſake ſhall then be renewed into a glorious eſtate not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion.</note> of the Righteous, that not onely they ſhall ſo riſe to glorie, but for their ſakes the very Creatures themſelues, and the whole frame of Gods Creation ſhall be renewed into a glorious eſtate not ſubiect to corruption; the power of Chriſts Reſurrection renewing all the World: for as the Creature had a part in the Curſe of man, as before we ſhewed: ſo the Scripture teacheth, that they ſhall haue their part in his Renouation: And when wee their Maſters ſhall be promoted, they that ſerue vs, ſhall put on new Liueries. <hi>Paul</hi> both generally applyeth it to <hi>the</hi>
